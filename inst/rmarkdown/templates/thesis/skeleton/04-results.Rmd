## False-Positive Rate and Specificity

False-positive rates and the specificity of clinical change methods were investigated in questionnaire and EMA scenarios with overall within-subjects effect sizes of CohenÂ´s _d_ $\approx$ 0, representing the scores of a control group in a clinical trial. Although some participants in these simulated scenarios showed a substantial symptom improvement or deterioration, the overall pre-post symptom changes were closely distributed around 0, with the vast majority of cases showing no meaningful changes in absolute scores. The main advantage of using zero-effect data sets for this analysis is that the absence of a general treatment effect, along with equally distributed random positive and negative effects, enables the a-priori assumption that proportions of cases identified as changed should be minimal in the most specific calculation methods. The respective cases would only constitute false-positive classifications (i.e. both classifications of improvement and of deterioration), as the number of truly changed participants would be _p_ = _tp_ + _fn_ = 0, implying that cases of true change could neither be detected (i.e. _tp_ = 0) nor overlooked (i.e. _fn_ = 0) in these scenarios. Following from their definitions, classification sensitivity (see Equation \@ref(eq:sensitivity)) could not be calculated under these conditions, while the classification specificity (see Equation \@ref(eq:specificity)) could be appropriately estimated with regard to the known _ground truth_ of the whole sample consisting of only negative (i.e. non-changed) cases.



The _false-positive rate (FPR)_ is given by:
\begin{equation}
FPR = \frac{fp}{n} = \frac{fp}{fp + tn} (\#eq:fpr)
\end{equation}

\par
Hence, classification methods can be compared regarding their false-positive rates and their specificity (i.e. probability of true-positive classifications) on the basis of this data source.
