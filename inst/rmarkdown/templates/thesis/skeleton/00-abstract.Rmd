Indikatoren wie Reli Change sind Maß für Veränderung auf Indi Level. Sie sind jedoch noch immer mit Gruppen-level Parametern (etwa Variabilität) konfundiert. Das führt zu Problemen, wie beispielsweise einer Abhängigkeit des RCI von der Pre-Level Ausprägung. In unserer Arbeit versuchen wir herauszufinden, ob ein auf EMA-basierter tatsächlich individualisierter RCI bessere Klassifizierungen aufweist.

Digital mental health and precision medicine practices introduce new ways of data acquisition and analysis into the field of psychiatric research, which have the potential to advance the individualization of psychotherapy. Within this line of research, the present study addresses two important problems which affect the validity of empirical findings in psychiatric research: (1) the limited precision of single-point assessment strategies for measuring psychological symptoms, and (2) the lack of truly individualized measures for assessing clinically significant change on the level of single patients. These issues could be minimized by applying individualized change criteria to ecological momentary assessment data. The two aims of this study were (1) to investigate the theoretically expected increases in sensitivity and specificity of clinical change estimates in clinical trials resulting from the use of multiple baseline and follow-up assessments, as practically implemented in ecological momentary assessment, as well as (2) to evaluate the psychometric quality of methods for determining meaningful change in longitudinal clinical trials. An exploratory simulation study was conducted, in which three clinical change methods (i.e. Percentage Change, Reliable Change Index, and the Individualized Reliable Change Index as a proposed adaptation of the RCI) were compared for both a classical questionnaire format and an EMA format of the PHQ-9 scale for depressive symptoms. The results suggest an accuracy advantage of repeated-assessment over single-point assessment approaches, with accuracy increases ranging from 17--22% in questionnaire scenarios and generally higher accuracy levels in EMA scenarios. Furthermore, individualized clinical change criteria generally resulted in higher sensitivity and specificity levels than criteria calculated from group-level information (i.e. assuming linear change), especially in repeated-assessment scenarios. Implications, strengths and limitations are discussed.
