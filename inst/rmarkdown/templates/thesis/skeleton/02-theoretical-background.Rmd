## Assessment of Treatment Effectiveness on a Group Level vs. Individual Level

Digital mental health and precision medicine practices introduce new ways of data acquisition and analysis into the field of psychiatric research, which have the potential to advance the individualization of psychotherapy. With the rise of digitally assisted interventions in clinical research and practice and the popularization of machine learning algorithms in precision medicine (e.g., treatment outcome prediction models), an emphasis on validity and data quality is necessary to achieve the goals of individualization in person-centered treatments.
\par
In order to evaluate new treatments in psychiatric research, patients are commonly monitored over the course of a therapy. This enables researchers to observe changes in their symptoms over time, aiming to find effects which can be attributed to the applied treatment. Then, the crucial part of the analysis is determining from which perspective the observed changes should be analyzed and interpreted to evaluate potential treatment effects. While most treatment outcome studies report standardized, group-level measures of treatment efficacy, it is often overlooked that individualized measures could give much more valuable insights on within-subjects treatment effects [@Lambert.2013, p. 149].
\par
Regarding the strength of evidence in study designs in general, the \enquote{\textit{gold standard}} of empirical clinical research are randomized-controlled trials (RCTs). They are characterized by the following components: experimental conditions and control conditions, random assignment of participants to conditions, and commonly double blinding (i.e., neither participants nor experimenters know which group each participant is assigned to).
\par
These characteristics provide a necessary basis for researchers to be able to reach conclusions about the effects of an investigated treatment , but there are other methodological problems on a deeper level that need to be considered to ensure sufficiently valid conditions for the type of causal inferences that researchers aim for. Well-studied, but often overlooked problems of commonly applied research designs in RCTs include, i.a., (1) limited precision of the predominantly used single-point assessment strategies for measuring psychological symptoms, and (2) a lack of methods for evaluating clinically significant symptom changes on a truly individualized basis.
\par
1. The first problem is caused by the common practice in clinical studies to assess psychological symptoms, which are often fluctuating in nature, only on single-point occasions, e.g., pre- and post-treatment and on a later follow-up assessment. This practice introduces a certain amount of measurement error and, thus, imprecision [@Fisher.2018; @Pfeiffer.2015; @Schuster.2020].
2. The second problem is concerned with the specific methods used to determine the clinical effectiveness of a treatment. @Estrada.2018 introduced a useful terminology for the distinction between two types of approaches to clinically significant change: \textit{average-based change approaches (ABC)} and \textit{individual-based change approaches (IBC)}. \textit{ABCs} examine clinically relevant changes only on a group-level (i.e. between subjects), whereas \textit{IBCs} directly identify individuals who show meaningful changes (i.e. within subjects). Changes on a group-level are typically measured as average differences between the group´s pre-treatment and post-treatment distributions of test scores, implemented in statistical hypothesis tests, which result in effect sizes (e.g., Cohen´s $d$, Hedge´s $g$) and corresponding significance levels. Individual changes, on the other hand, are examined using a variety of different clinical significance methods, which may include standardized pre-post differences and standard errors or variations of linear regressions [@Anderson.2014; @Estrada.2018; @Ferrer.2014]. An example for an IBC approach is the popular Reliable Change Index [@Jacobson.1984; @Jacobson.1991], which determines individual treatment responses by evaluating within-subjects pre-post differences, while also relying on group-level variance estimates.


\par
The issues mentioned above could be minimized by applying individualized change criteria to ecological momentary assessment data, as part of the increasingly widespread paradigm of digital mental health studies.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
## Ecological Momentary Assessment

Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), also known as Ambulatory Assessment [e.g., see @Fahrenberg.2007], Experience Sampling Method (ESM) [e.g., see @Csikszentmihalyi.2014b; @Vork.2019], or Real-Time Data Capture (RTDC) [e.g., see @Stone.2007], is the repeated assessment of self-reported symptoms, behavioral or physiological variables via short scales or questionnaires, commonly presented on mobile devices, in order to measure the construct directly in the subject´s natural environment [@EbnerPriemer.2009]. The method gained popularity as part of the broad concept of Digital Mental Health, which includes methods for the assessment of psychopathology as well as for treatment assistance with digital tools.
\par
EMA is especially suitable for accurately capturing psychological constructs with high intra-individual variability over time (e.g., depression, anxiety, or craving). Despite oftentimes high sampling frequencies, it can be applied efficiently, as it enables highly informative insights from data that is gathered at a minimal cost and effort. Longitudinal EMA designs typically consist of a small number of items that require minimal effort and time for the respondents to answer [@Rot.2012; @Shiffman.2008]. As these short self-reports can be presented in smartphone apps or computer programs, this approach forms a powerful, yet feasible opportunity to study the progression of affective states and behaviors on an individual level.
\par
This diagnostic format could be seen as a bridge between empirical research and clinical practice: Current research in psychiatry has a tendency towards producing group-level based evidence, while the actual treatment of patients is much more concerned with their individual psychopathology. Any practical work with them is in itself a study of processes within each person. EMA formats can benefit both fields by facilitating a deeper understanding of complex psychological processes. For instance, EMA is applied in psychiatric research and therapy, e.g., to capture mood instability in bipolar disorders [e.g., @Holmes.2016] or fluctuating symptoms of depression [e.g., @Armey.2015; @Silk.2011]. Through this form of repeated measurement, it is possible to assess relevant information at random or non-random times of the day or week (e.g., directly after panic attacks in patients with panic disorders, or every morning in depressive patients), while always embedded in the participant´s normal environment and everyday life, instead of in a laboratory, a clinic, or a counseling center. It therefore has the inherent advantage of eliminating lab-specific response tendencies, which is certainly also coupled with the disadvantages of introducing other, environment-specific sources of bias, and possibly the risk of a lower response rate than usually obtained in settings with personally given instructions.
\par
Assessing symptoms over time through EMA may capture more accurately each individual´s treatment responses, but to be able to interpret the course of multiple individual observations, it is important to consider that symptom trajectories show higher variability when captured with EMA than with classical questionnaire assessments. The presence of individual fluctuation between single assessments raises the essential question how to interpret these score changes, and furthermore, what to conclude about the effectiveness of the given treatment for a given individual on the basis of this data. Several questions need to be answered in the process of developing an analytic strategy.

## Methods for the Classification of Meaningful Change in Clinical Research

Psychiatric research and practice in any context that involves repeated testing of subjects regarding some measurable construct can benefit from being able to determine if a specific change in test scores over time could be attributed to measurement error alone or if it exceeds this error interval significantly and could therefore be attributed to another influence, e.g., an intervention. The application of this idea and other highly relevant clinical change methods will be explained in detail in Chapter \@ref(method).
\par
The broad term clinical significance comprises a variety of different approaches to assess how practically meaningful a change in symptom severity is. Quoting @Bauer.2004b, \enquote{clinically significant change refers to meaningful change in individual patient functioning during psychosocial or medical interventions}. There are many variations of the same broad concept of meaningful differences (e.g., the Clinically Significant Improvement _CSI_, Clinically Significant Difference _CSD_, the Minimal Detectable Change _MDC_, the Minimal Clinically Important Difference _MCID_, and the Minimal Important Difference _MID_) and there are many more approaches to calculating estimates which represent the extent of individual change relative to some error variance, as well as to other subjects. The variations of these individual criteria and formulas can be roughly divided into two approaches, which in practice are not always mutually exclusive: (1) _distribution-based_ methods (i.e. interpreting score changes in relation to the underlying distribution of test scores in a relevant sample) and (2) _anchor-based_ methods (i.e. involving external criteria as references for clinically meaningful change, e.g., a cutoff criterion of 2 between-subjects standard deviations for significance) [@Estrada.2018; @Haley.2006]. The clinical significance approaches included in this study´s analyses represent both of these categories separately and in combination.

## Estimating the Precision of Clinical Significance Methods {#theory-pss}

The clinical significance methods investigated in this study are both statistical tests and diagnostic criteria, which makes their performance dependent not only on their ability to detect existing meaningful changes, but also on their ability to detect cases without meaningful changes. To evaluate the performance of classification methods (e.g., bio-medical tests for medical conditions), different commonly used metrics can be calculated from their classifications, if reference classifications from another method are available for comparison. The classes resulting from the investigated method can then, for each class respectively, be categorized into true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN) classifications (i.e., in a contingency table or confusion matrix). Naturally, in the optimal case, the _true_ classes of the observed object are known and can be used as a reference, resulting in the most precise and meaningful estimates for the performance of the classification method. The labels _positive_ and _negative_ are not necessary, but describe the most common binary classification problems. Regardless of the number of classes, there exist many performance measures which can be computed from the frequencies of TP, TN, FP, and FN cases. For the present study, the following quality measures will be relevant [e.g., see  @Berthold.2020, p. 107].
\newline
\par \noindent
_Sensitivity_, also known as _recall_ or _true-positive rate_, is the probability of a given method to correctly identify positive cases.
\begin{equation}
Sensitivity = \frac{TP}{P} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN} (\#eq:sensitivity)
\end{equation}

\par \noindent
_Specificity_, also known as _selectivity_ or _true-negative rate_, is the probability of a given method to correctly identify negative cases.
\begin{equation}
Specificity = \frac{TN}{N} = \frac{TN}{TN + FP} (\#eq:specificity)
\end{equation}

## Purpose of the Study

The present thesis forms an in-depth investigation of the theoretically expected increases in sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic approaches in clinical trials through the use of multiple baseline and follow-up assessments, as practically implemented in ecological momentary assessment.
\par
Furthermore, this study is concerned with the comparison of currently used techniques for determining meaningful change in longitudinal clinical trials, which follow either a single-point approach or an intense-assessment approach to measuring psychopathology. An individualized adaptation of the Reliable Change Index, the RCI\textsubscript{ind,pre-SD}, which implements within-subjects rather than between-subjects variability, is proposed and tested. Agreement and differences between these estimates for the clinical significance of symptom changes will be examined in order to evaluate the psychometric quality of their classifications.
\par
For the purpose of investigating the above-mentioned research questions in combination, an exploratory simulation study will be conducted, in which the included clinical change methods will be compared for both a classical questionnaire format and an EMA format of a short scale for depressive symptoms.
