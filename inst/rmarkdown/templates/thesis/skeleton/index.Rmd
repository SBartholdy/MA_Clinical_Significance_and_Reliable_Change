  I want to thank my direct supervisor Dr. Raphael Schuster for his unlimited help and kind encouragement throughout the whole process of writing this thesis. I also want to thank my indirect supervisor Ao. Univ.–Prof. Dr. Anton–Rupert Laireiter for always offering his advice and expertise. \par
  Apart from the excellent supervision, I´m thankful to Raphael Schuster, Manuela Larissa Schreyer, Tim Kaiser, Thomas Berger, Jan Philipp Klein, Steffen Moritz, Anton Rupert Laireiter, and Wolfgang Trutschnig for providing me with simulated data sets which they generated for their recent study on statistical power of Intense Pre-Post Assessment approaches. \par
  This thesis was written using the _Salzburgthesisdown_ template ^[\url{https://github.com/irmingard/salzburgthesisdown}] by Veronika Priesner. Based on the _Thesisdown_ package ^[\url{https://github.com/ismayc/thesisdown}] [@Ismay.2020], this format allows for the preparation and formatting of theses using a combination of R code, Markdown and \LaTeX\ syntax.
#\par
#Finally, I want to thank my parents Laura and Frank for supporting me unconditionally throughout every step of my life and education. I dedicate this thesis, being the most difficult task of my life yet, to both of you, because without you I would not have been able to fulfill any of the dreams nor achieve any of the goals that I had in my life until today.

#  This is an example of a thesis setup to use the reed thesis document class

Above is the YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) header that includes a lot of metadata used to produce the document.  Be careful with spacing in this header!
If you'd prefer to not include a Dedication, for example, simply delete lines 17 and 18 above or add a # before them to comment them out.  If you have other LaTeX packages you would like to include, delete the # before header-includes and list the packages after hyphens on new lines.

<!-- You'll need to include the order that you'd like Rmd files to appear in the _bookdown.yml file for
PDF files and also delete the # before rmd_files: there.  You'll want to not include 00(two-hyphens)prelim.Rmd
and 00-abstract.Rmd since they are handled in the YAML above differently for the PDF version.
