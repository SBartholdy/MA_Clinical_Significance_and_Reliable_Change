  I want to thank my supervisor, Ao. Univ.–Prof. Dr. Anton–Rupert Laireiter, for always offering his advice and expertise and allowing me to work as flexibly and as freely as I needed to.
  \par
  I also want to thank my second supervisor, Dr. Raphael Schuster, for his unlimited help and kind encouragement throughout the whole process of writing this thesis. His level of interest in the topic and his constructive feedback were inspiring to me and helped me very much.
  \par
  Apart from the excellent supervision by both of them, I´m thankful to the whole team of authors consisting of Raphael Schuster, Manuela Larissa Schreyer, Tim Kaiser, Thomas Berger, Jan Philipp Klein, Steffen Moritz, Anton-Rupert Laireiter, and Wolfgang Trutschnig for providing me with data which they generated for their own recent study on the statistical power of intense pre-post assessment approaches.
  \par
  On a side note, I want to acknowledge that this thesis was written using the _Salzburgthesisdown_ template ^[\url{https://github.com/irmingard/salzburgthesisdown}] by Veronika Priesner. Based on the _Thesisdown_ package ^[\url{https://github.com/ismayc/thesisdown}] [@Ismay.2020], this format allows for the preparation and formatting of theses using a combination of R code, Markdown and \LaTeX\ syntax.
  \par
  Finally, I want to thank my parents Laura and Frank, as well as my grandparents, for supporting me unconditionally throughout every step of my life and education. I dedicate this thesis, being the most difficult task of my life yet, to you, because without you I would not have been able to fulfill any of the dreams nor achieve any of the goals that I had in my life until today.

Above is the YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) header that includes a lot of metadata used to produce the document.  Be careful with spacing in this header!
If you'd prefer to not include a Dedication, for example, simply delete lines 17 and 18 above or add a # before them to comment them out.  If you have other LaTeX packages you would like to include, delete the # before header-includes and list the packages after hyphens on new lines.
