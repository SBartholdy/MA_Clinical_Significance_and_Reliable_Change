# Introduction

The most common paradigm in clinical research is the pre-post design, in which a construct is repeatedly measured over time to evaluate changes in this construct and reach conclusions about the influences that led to the observed changes. The research process then includes statistical tests for the hypothesis, which, in most studies, would regard the efficacy or effectiveness of a therapy or a type of medication. The validity of the resulting inferences strongly depends on the operationalization of the construct, as well as on the methods used to evaluate changes in test scores [@Estrada.2018]. These approaches for evaluating clinically significant changes over time can vary strongly in their definitions and outcomes, and three of them will be explored in detail within this study (i.e. the Reliable Change Index, the Percentage Change method, and an Individualized Reliable Change Index).

The present thesis aims to address two important problems which affect the validity of certain types of empirical findings in psychiatric research: (1) the limited precision of single-point assessment strategies for measuring psychological symptoms, and (2) the lack of assessment methods for clinically significant changes on an individual level.

Starting with a theoretical introduction into both problems, the methodological analyses in this thesis will explore and test possible solutions for increasing the validity of research designs.
