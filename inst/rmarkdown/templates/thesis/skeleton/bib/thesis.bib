 abstract = {Machine learning (ML) offers robust statistical and probabilistic techniques that can help to make sense of large amounts of data. This scoping review paper aims to broadly explore the nature of research activity using ML in the context of psychological talk therapies, highlighting the scope of current methods and considerations for clinical practice and directions for future research. Using a systematic search methodology, fifty-one studies were identified. A narrative synthesis indicates two types of studies, those who developed and tested an ML model (k=44), and those who reported on the feasibility of a particular treatment tool that uses an ML algorithm (k=7). Most model development studies used supervised learning techniques to classify or predict labeled treatment process or outcome data, whereas others used unsupervised techniques to identify clusters in the unlabeled patient or treatment data. Overall, the current applications of ML in psychotherapy research demonstrated a range of possible benefits for indications of treatment process, adherence, therapist skills and treatment response prediction, as well as ways to accelerate research through automated behavioral or linguistic process coding. Given the novelty and potential of this research field, these proof-of-concept studies are encouraging, however, do not necessarily translate to improved clinical practice (yet).},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Neurocognitive testing is widely performed for the assessment of concussion. Athletic trainers can use preseason baselines with reliable change indices (RCIs) to ascertain whether concussed athletes' cognitive abilities are below preinjury levels. Although the percentage of healthy individuals who show decline on any individual test is determined by its RCI's confidence level (eg, 10{\%} false-positive rate using an RCI with an 80{\%} confidence interval), the expected rate of 1 or more significant RCIs across multiple indices is unclear.

OBJECTIVE

To use a Monte Carlo simulation procedure to estimate the normal rate (ie, base rate) of significant decline on 1 or more RCIs in multitest batteries.

RESULTS {\&} CONCLUSION

For batteries producing 7 or more uncorrelated RCIs (80{\%} confidence intervals), the majority of normal individuals would show significant declines on at least 1 RCI. Expected rates are lower for tests with fewer indices, higher inter-RCI correlations, and more stringent impairment criteria. These reference points can help testers interpret RCI output for multitest batteries.},

@article{Pfeiffer.2015,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Classification of depression severity can guide treatment decisions. This study examined whether using repeated mobile health assessments to determine symptom trajectories is a potentially useful method for classifying depression severity.

METHODS

344 primary care patients with depression were identified and recruited as part of a program of mobile health symptom monitoring and self-management support. Depression symptoms were measured weekly via interactive voice response (IVR) calls using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Trajectory analysis of weekly IVR PHQ-9 scores from baseline through week 6 was used to subgroup patients according to similar trajectories. Multivariable linear regression was used to determine whether the trajectories predicted 12-week PHQ-9 scores after adjusting for baseline and 6-week PHQ-9 scores.

RESULTS

The optimal trajectory analysis model included 5 non-intersecting trajectories. The subgroups of patients assigned to each trajectory had mean baseline PHQ-9s of 19.7, 14.5, 9.5, 5.0, and 2.0, and respective mean decreases in PHQ-9s over six weeks of .3, 2.0, 3.6, 2.3, and 1.9. In regression analyses, each trajectory significantly predicted 12-week PHQ-9 scores (using the modal trajectory as a reference) after adjusting for both baseline and 6-week PHQ-9 scores.

LIMITATIONS

Treatment history was unknown, findings may not be generalizable to new episodes of treatment.

CONCLUSIONS

Depression symptom trajectories based on mobile health assessments are predictive of future depression outcomes, even after accounting for typical assessments at baseline and a single follow-up time point. Approaches to classify patients׳ disease status that involve multiple repeated assessments may provide more accurate and useful information for depression management compared to lower frequency monitoring.},

@article{Raymond.2006,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

This paper compares four techniques used to assess change in neuropsychological test scores before and after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), and includes a rationale for the classification of a patient as overall impaired.

METHODS

A total of 55 patients were tested before and after surgery on the MicroCog neuropsychological test battery. A matched control group underwent the same testing regime to generate test-retest reliabilities and practice effects. Two techniques designed to assess statistical change were used: the Reliable Change Index (RCI), modified for practice, and the Standardised Regression-based (SRB) technique. These were compared against two fixed cutoff techniques (standard deviation and 20{\%} change methods).

RESULTS

The incidence of decline across test scores varied markedly depending on which technique was used to describe change. The SRB method identified more patients as declined on most measures. In comparison, the two fixed cutoff techniques displayed relatively reduced sensitivity in the detection of change.

CONCLUSIONS

Overall change in an individual can be described provided the investigators choose a rational cutoff based on likely spread of scores due to chance. A cutoff value of {\textgreater} or =20{\%} of test scores used provided acceptable probability based on the number of tests commonly encountered. Investigators must also choose a test battery that minimises shared variance among test scores.},

@article{Rozental.2019,
 abstract = {Background: Negative effects of psychological treatments have recently received increased attention in both research and clinical practice. Most investigations have focused on determining the occurrence and characteristics of deterioration and other adverse and unwanted events, such as interpersonal issues, indicating that patients quite frequently experience such incidents in treatment. However, non-response is also negative if it might have prolonged an ongoing condition and caused unnecessary suffering. Yet few attempts have been made to directly explore non-response in psychological treatment or its plausible causes. Internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) has been found effective for a number of diagnoses but has not yet been systematically explored with regard to those patients who do not respond. Methods: The current study collected and aggregated data from 2,866 patients in 29 clinical randomized trials of ICBT for three categories of diagnoses: anxiety disorders, depression, and other (erectile dysfunction, relationship problems, and gambling disorder). Raw scores from each patient variable were used in an individual patient data meta-analysis to determine the rate of non-response on the primary outcome measure for each clinical trial, while its potential predictors were examined using binomial logistic regression. The reliable change index (RCI) was used to classify patients as non-responders. Results: Of the 2,118 patients receiving treatment, and when applying a RCI of z $\geq$ 1.96, 567 (26.8{\%}) were classified as non-responders. In terms of predictors, patients with higher symptom severity on the primary outcome measure at baseline, Odds Ratio (OR) = 2.04, having a primary anxiety disorder (OR = 5.75), and being of male gender (OR = 1.80), might have higher odds of not responding to treatment. Conclusion: Non-response seems to occur among approximately a quarter of all patients in ICBT, with predictors related to greater symptoms, anxiety disorders, and gender indicating increasing the odds of not responding. However, the results need to be replicated before establishing their clinical relevance, and the use of the RCI as a way of determining non-response needs to be validated by other means, such as by interviewing patients classified as non-responders.},

 abstract = {Background: Procrastination can be stressful and frustrating, but it seldom causes any major distress. However, for some people, it can become problematic, resulting in anxiety, lowered mood, physical complaints, and decreased well-being. Still, few studies have investigated the benefits of targeting procrastination. In addition, no attempt has previously been made to determine the overall efficacy of providing psychological treatments. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted by searching for eligible records in Scopus, Proquest, and Google Scholar. Only randomized controlled trials comparing psychological treatments for procrastination to an inactive comparator and assessing the outcomes by a self-report measure were included. A random effects model was used to determine the standardized mean difference Hedge's g at post-treatment. Furthermore, test for heterogeneity was performed, fail-safe N was calculated, and the risk of bias was explored. The study was pre-registered at Prospero: CRD42017069981. Results: A total of 1,639 records were identified, with 12 studies (21 comparisons, N = 718) being included in the quantitative synthesis. Overall effect size g when comparing treatment to control was 0.34, 95{\%} Confidence Interval [0.11, 0.56], but revealing significant heterogeneity, Q(20) = 46.99, p {\textless} 0.00, and I2 = 61.14{\%}, 95{\%} CI [32.83, 84.24]. Conducting a subgroup analysis of three out of four studies using cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) found an effect size g of 0.55, 95{\%} CI [0.32, 0.77], and no longer showing any heterogeneity, Q(4) = 3.92, p = 0.42, I2 = 0.00{\%}, 95{\%} CI [0.00, 91.02] (N = 236). Risk of publication bias, as assessed by the Egger's test was not significant, z = -1.05, p = 0.30, fail-safe N was 370 studies, and there was some risk of bias as rated by two independent researchers. In terms of secondary outcomes, the self-report measures were too varied to present an aggregated estimate. Conclusions: Psychological treatments seem to have small benefits on procrastination, but the studies displayed significant between-study variation. Meanwhile, CBT was associated with a moderate benefit, but consisted of only three studies. Recommendations for future research are provided, including the use of more valid and reliable outcomes and a screening interview at intake.},

@article{Nelson.2015b,
 abstract = {Screening and diagnostic procedures often require a physician's subjective interpretation of a patient's test result using an ordered categorical scale to define the patient's disease severity. Because of wide variability observed between physicians' ratings, many large-scale studies have been conducted to quantify agreement between multiple experts' ordinal classifications in common diagnostic procedures such as mammography. However, very few statistical approaches are available to assess agreement in these large-scale settings. Many existing summary measures of agreement rely on extensions of Cohen's kappa. These are prone to prevalence and marginal distribution issues, become increasingly complex for more than three experts, or are not easily implemented. Here we propose a model-based approach to assess agreement in large-scale studies based upon a framework of ordinal generalized linear mixed models. A summary measure of agreement is proposed for multiple experts assessing the same sample of patients' test results according to an ordered categorical scale. This measure avoids some of the key flaws associated with Cohen's kappa and its extensions. Simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate the validity of the approach with comparison with commonly used agreement measures. The proposed methods are easily implemented using the software package R and are applied to two large-scale cancer agreement studies.},

 abstract = {As mobile data capture tools for patient-reported outcomes proliferate in clinical research, a key dimension of measure performance is sensitivity to change. This study compared performance of patient-reported measures of mindfulness, depression, and anxiety symptoms using traditional paper-and-pencil forms versus real-time, ambulatory measurement of symptoms via ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Sixty-seven emotionally distressed older adults completed paper-and-pencil measures of mindfulness, depression, and anxiety along with two weeks of identical items reported during ambulatory monitoring via EMA before and after participation in a randomized trial of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) or a health education intervention. We calculated effect sizes for these measures across both measurement approaches and estimated the Number-Needed-to-Treat (NNT) in both measurement conditions. Study outcomes greatly differed depending on which measurement method was used. When EMA was used to measure clinical symptoms, older adults who participated in the MBSR intervention had significantly higher mindfulness and significantly lower depression and anxiety than participants in the health education intervention at post-treatment. However, these significant changes in symptoms were not found when outcomes were measured with paper-and-pencil measures. The NNT for mindfulness and depression measures administered through EMA were approximately 25-50{\%} lower than NNTs derived from paper-and-pencil administration. Sensitivity to change in anxiety was similar across administration modes. In conclusion, EMA measures of depression and mindfulness substantially outperformed paper-and-pencil measures with the same items. The additional resources associated with EMA in clinical trials would seem to be offset by its greater sensitivity to detect change in key outcome variables.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

To assess the psychometric properties of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) as a screening instrument for depression in elderly patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) without known depression.

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING

DM and COPD patients aged {\textgreater}59 years were selected from general practices. A test-retest was conducted in 105 patients. Criterion validity, using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview psychiatric interview to diagnose major depressive disorder (MDD) and any depressive disorder (ADD) as diagnostic standard, was evaluated for both summed and algorithm-based PHQ-9 score in 713 patients. Correlations with quality of life and severity of illness were calculated to assess construct validity.

RESULTS

Cohen's kappa for the algorithm-based score was 0.71 for MDD and 0.69 for ADD. Correlation for test-retest assessment of the summed score was 0.91. The algorithm-based score had low sensitivity and high specificity, but both sensitivity and specificity were high for the optimal cut-off point of 6 on the summed score for ADD (Se 95.6{\%}, Sp 81.0{\%}). Correlations between summed score and quality of life and severity of illness were acceptable.

CONCLUSION

The summed PHQ-9 score seems a valid and reliable screening instrument for depression in elderly primary care patients with DM and COPD.},

For PHQ-9 cut-off scores 5-15, bivariate random effects meta-analysis was used to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity, separately, among studies that used semistructured diagnostic interviews, which are designed for administration by clinicians; fully structured interviews, which are designed for lay administration; and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric (MINI) diagnostic interviews, a brief fully structured interview. Sensitivity and specificity were examined among participant subgroups and, separately, using meta-regression, considering all subgroup variables in a single model.

RESULTS

Data were obtained for 58 of 72 eligible studies (total n=17 357; major depression cases n=2312). Combined sensitivity and specificity was maximized at a cut-off score of 10 or above among studies using a semistructured interview (29 studies, 6725 participants; sensitivity 0.88, 95{\%} confidence interval 0.83 to 0.92; specificity 0.85, 0.82 to 0.88). Across cut-off scores 5-15, sensitivity with semistructured interviews was 5-22{\%} higher than for fully structured interviews (MINI excluded; 14 studies, 7680 participants) and 2-15{\%} higher than for the MINI (15 studies, 2952 participants). Specificity was similar across diagnostic interviews. The PHQ-9 seems to be similarly sensitive but may be less specific for younger patients than for older patients; a cut-off score of 10 or above can be used regardless of age..

CONCLUSIONS

PHQ-9 sensitivity compared with semistructured diagnostic interviews was greater than in previous conventional meta-analyses that combined reference standards. A cut-off score of 10 or above maximized combined sensitivity and specificity overall and for subgroups.

Power depends on population effect sizes, which are unknown in practice. In conventional power analysis, effect size estimates, however, are often used as population values, which could result in underpowered studies. Uncertainty in effect size estimates has been considered in other sample size planning contexts (e.g., t-test, ANOVA), but has not been handled properly for planning mediation studies. In the current study, we proposed an easy-to-use sample size planning method for testing mediation with uncertainty in effect size estimates considered. We conducted simulation studies to demonstrate the impact of uncertainty in effect size estimates on power of testing mediation, and to provide sample size suggestions under different levels of uncertainty. Empirical examples were provided to illustrate the application of our method. R functions and a web application were developed to facilitate implementation.},

Although daily data potentially often have weekly cyclical patterns (e.g., stress may be higher on weekdays and lower on weekends), the majority of daily diary studies have ignored this possibility. In this study, we investigated the effect of ignoring existing weekly cycles. We reanalyzed an empirical dataset (stress and alcohol consumption) and performed Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the impact of omitting weekly cycles. In the empirical dataset, ignoring cycles led to the inference of a significant within-person X-Y relation whereas modeling cycles suggested that this relationship did not exist. Simulation results indicated that ignoring cycles that existed in both X and Y led to bias in the estimated within-person X-Y relationship. The amount and direction of bias depended on the magnitude of the cycles, magnitude of the true within-person X-Y relation, and synchronization of the cycles. We encourage researchers conducting daily diary studies to address potential weekly cycles in their data. We provide guidelines for detecting and modeling cycles to remove their influence and discuss challenges of causal inference in daily experience studies.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

Psychological treatments can relieve mental distress and improve well-being, and the dissemination of evidence-based methods can help patients gain access to the right type of aid. Meanwhile, Internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (ICBT) has shown promising results for many psychiatric disorders. However, research on the potential for negative effects of psychological treatments has been lacking.

METHOD

An individual patient data meta-analysis of 29 clinical trials of ICBT (N = 2,866) was performed using the Reliable Change Index for each primary outcome measures to distinguish deterioration rates among patients in treatment and control conditions. Statistical analyses of predictors were conducted using generalized linear mixed models. Missing data was handled by multiple imputation.

RESULTS

Deterioration rates were 122 (5.8{\%}) in treatment and 130 (17.4{\%}) in control conditions. Relative to receiving treatment, patients in a control condition had higher odds of deteriorating, odds ratios (ORs) = 3.10, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) [2.21, 4.34]. Clinical severity at pretreatment was related to lower odds, OR = 0.62, 95{\%} CI [0.50, 0.77], and OR = 0.51, 95{\%} CI [0.51, 0.80], for treatment and control conditions. In terms of sociodemographic variables, being in a relationship, OR = 0.58, 95{\%} CI [0.35, 0.95], having at least a university degree, OR = 0.54, 95{\%} CI [0.33, 0.88], and being older, OR = 0.78, 95{\%} CI, [0.62, 0.98], were also associated with lower odds of deterioration, but only for patients assigned to a treatment condition.

CONCLUSION

Deterioration among patients receiving ICBT or being in a control condition can occur and should be monitored by researchers to reverse and prevent a negative treatment trend. (PsycINFO Database Record},

 abstract = {AIMS

Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) captures real-time reports in subjects' natural environments. This experiment manipulated EMA frequency to estimate effects on abstinence and peri-cessation subjective experiences.

DESIGN

In this randomized trial, subjects had an equal chance of being assigned to low-frequency (once) or high-frequency (six times) daily EMA for 4 weeks (1 week pre- and 3 weeks post-cessation). Participants completed six office visits over 5 weeks and 6- and 12-week follow-up telephone interviews.

SETTING

Community participants were recruited from central New Jersey, USA.

PARTICIPANTS

One hundred and ten adult daily smokers seeking to quit smoking were included in intent-to-treat analyses of tobacco abstinence; 94 were available for secondary analyses of peri-cessation subjective ratings.

MEASUREMENTS

Primary outcomes were cessation (abstaining at least 24 hours within 2 weeks of attempting to quit) and prolonged abstinence (no relapse between weeks 2 and 12 post-quit). Secondary outcomes were mean levels and growth in ratings of cigarette craving, affect and quitting motivation and self-efficacy.

FINDINGS

EMA frequency was unrelated to cessation (odds ratio = 1.367, 95{\%} confidence interval = 0.603-3.098) or prolonged abstinence (odds ratio = 1.040, 95{\%} confidence interval = 0.453-2.388) in intent-to-treat analyses. High-frequency EMA was associated with lower craving (B = -0.544, standard error (SE) = 0.183, P = 0.004, anxiety (B = -0.424, SE = 0.170, P = 0.015), anger (B = -0.474, SE = 0.139, P = 0.001), hunger (B = -0.388, SE = 0.170, P = 0.025) and positive affect (B = -0.430, SE = 0.196, P = 0.03).

CONCLUSIONS

In smokers trying to quit, more frequent ecological momentary assessment self-monitoring results in lower craving, anxiety, anger, hunger and positive affect. It is not clear whether this translates into higher rates of smoking abstinence.},

@article{McMillan.2010,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Although the PHQ-9 is widely used in primary care, little is known about its performance in quantifying improvement. The original validation study of the PHQ-9 defined clinically significant change as a post-treatment score of $\leq$9 combined with improvement of 50{\%}, but it is unclear how this relates to other theoretically informed methods of defining successful outcome. We compared a range of definitions of clinically significant change (original definition, asymptomatic criterion, reliable and clinically significant change criteria a, b and c) in a clinical trial of a community-level depression intervention.

METHOD

Randomised Control Trial of collaborative care for depression. Levels of agreement were calculated between the standard definition, other definitions, and gold-standard diagnostic interview.

RESULTS

The standard definition showed good agreement (kappa{\textgreater}0.60) with the other definitions and had moderate, though acceptable, agreement with the diagnostic interview (kappa=0.58). The standard definition corresponded closely to reliable and clinically significant change criterion c, the recommended method of quantifying improvement when clinical and non-clinical distributions overlap.

LIMITATIONS

The absence of follow-up data meant that an asymptomatic criterion rather than remission or recovery criteria were used.

CONCLUSION

The close agreement between the standard definition and reliable and clinically significant change criterion c provides some support for the standard definition of improvement. However, it may be preferable to use a reliable change index rather than 50{\%} improvement. Remission status, based on the asymptomatic range and a lower PHQ-9 score, may provide a useful additional category of clinical change.},

 abstract = {This report summarizes recommendations from the ACNP Task Force on the conceptualization of remission and its implications for defining recovery, relapse, recurrence, and response for clinical investigators and practicing clinicians. Given the strong implications of remission for better function and a better prognosis, remission is a valid, clinically relevant end point for both practitioners and investigators. Not all depressed patients, however, will reach remission. Response is a less desirable primary outcome in trials because it depends highly on the initial (often single) baseline measure of symptom severity. It is recommended that remission be ascribed after 3 consecutive weeks during which minimal symptom status (absence of both sadness and reduced interest/pleasure along with the presence of fewer than three of the remaining seven DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criterion symptoms) is maintained. Once achieved, remission can only be lost if followed by a relapse. Recovery is ascribed after at least 4 months following the onset of remission, during which a relapse has not occurred. Recovery, once achieved, can only be lost if followed by a recurrence. Day-to-day functioning and quality of life are important secondary end points, but they were not included in the proposed definitions of response, remission, recovery, relapse, or recurrence. These recommendations suggest that symptom ratings that measure all nine criterion symptom domains to define a major depressive episode are preferred as they provide a more certain ascertainment of remission. These recommendations were based largely on logic, the need for internal consistency, and clinical experience owing to the lack of empirical evidence to test these concepts. Research to evaluate these recommendations empirically is needed.},

The purpose of this study was to use daily {\textquotedbl}Mental Health Telemetry{\textquotedbl} (MHT) to prospectively record change in depressive and anxiety symptoms for depressed patients receiving augmentation treatment, and determine the extent and predictive capacity of early changes. We report results of a 6-week, open-label study of the addition of quetiapine XR (range, 50-300 mg) for adult patients (n = 26) with major depressive disorder who were nonresponsive to antidepressant treatment. In addition to regular study visits, all participants completed daily, wirelessly transmitted self-report ratings of symptoms on a Smartphone. Daily and 3-day moving average mean scores were calculated, and associations between early symptom change and eventual response to treatment were determined. Improvement in depressive and anxiety symptoms was identified as early as day 1 of treatment. Of the total decline in depression severity over 6 weeks, 9{\%} was present at day 1, 28{\%} at day 2, 39{\%} at days 3 and 4, 65{\%} at day 7, and 80{\%} at day 10. Self-report rating of early improvement ($\geq$20{\%}) in depressive symptoms at day 7 significantly predicted responder status at week 6 (P = 0.03). Clinician-rated depressive and anxiety symptoms only became significantly associated with responder status at day 14. In conclusion, very early changes in depressive symptoms were identified using MHT, early changes accounted for most of total change, and MHT-recorded improvement as early as day 7 significantly predicted response to treatment at study end point.},

Factor analysis failed to confirm the one-factor model previously reported for the PHQ-9, but two factors evidenced good fit for the BDI-II. Both scales converged more with each other than with the Sheehan Disability Scale at pre- but not at posttreatment. Responsiveness to change of PHQ-9 and BDI-II was similar at both posttreatment and follow-up. The consistency of agreement on indices of clinical significance was fair to moderate, but the BDI-II categorised a greater proportion of participants with severe depression than the PHQ-9. The BDI-II and PHQ-9 demonstrated adequate reliability, convergent/discriminant validity, and similar responsiveness to change. Differences were found in how they categorised severity. Pending the results of further studies, the attributes of the PHQ-9, of being shorter and based on the diagnostic criteria for depression, may indicate an advantage over the BDI-II.},

@article{vanderElst.2013,
 abstract = {Serial cognitive assessment is conducted to monitor changes in the cognitive abilities of patients over time. At present, mainly the regression-based change and the ANCOVA approaches are used to establish normative data for serial cognitive assessment. These methods are straightforward, but they have some severe drawbacks. For example, they can only consider the data of two measurement occasions. In this article, we propose three alternative normative methods that are not hampered by these problems-that is, multivariate regression, the standard linear mixed model (LMM), and the linear mixed model combined with multiple imputation (LMM with MI) approaches. The multivariate regression method is primarily useful when a small number of repeated measurements are taken at fixed time points. When the data are more unbalanced, the standard LMM and the LMM with MI methods are more appropriate because they allow for a more adequate modeling of the covariance structure. The standard LMM has the advantage that it is easier to conduct and that it does not require a Monte Carlo component. The LMM with MI, on the other hand, has the advantage that it can flexibly deal with missing responses and missing covariate values at the same time. The different normative methods are illustrated on the basis of the data of a large longitudinal study in which a cognitive test (the Stroop Color Word Test) was administered at four measurement occasions (i.e., at baseline and 3, 6, and 12~years later). The results are discussed and suggestions for future research are provided.},

@article{Vork.2019,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Confirming treatment response in clinical trials for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is challenging, due to the lack of biomarkers and limitations of the currently available symptom assessment tools. The Experience Sampling Method (ESM) might overcome these limitations by collecting digital assessments randomly and repeatedly during daily life. This study evaluated differences in change in abdominal pain between real-time (ie, ESM) and retrospective (ie, Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale [GSRS] and an end-of-day symptom diary) measurements, using data of an RCT on escitalopram vs placebo in patients with IBS and comorbid panic disorder.

METHODS

Twenty-nine IBS patients with comorbid panic disorder were included in a 6-month RCT. The GSRS, diary, and ESM were completed at baseline (t~=~0) and after 3 (t~=~3) and 6~months (t~=~6). Linear mixed models were used.

KEY RESULTS

Experience Sampling Method analyses revealed a significant interaction between escitalopram and time, and ESM abdominal pain scores were 1.4 points lower in the escitalopram group compared to placebo at t~=~6 (on a 1-to-7 scale; P~=~0.021). When including the interaction with momentary anxiety, the reduction in abdominal pain scores in escitalopram vs placebo was even more pronounced for higher levels of anxiety. Average GSRS- and end-of-day abdominal pain scores were not significantly different between escitalopram and placebo at t~=~3 and 6.

CONCLUSIONS {\&} INFERENCES

Real-time ESM has the potential to capture treatment response more sensitively compared to a retrospective end-of-day GI symptom diary and the GSRS, by taking into account day-to-day symptom variability as well as momentary factors that might moderate treatment effect, such as anxiety.},

@article{Wang.2020,
 abstract = {In psychological and educational measurement, it is often of interest to assess change in an individual. The current study expanded on previous research by introducing methods that can evaluate individual change on multiple latent traits measured on multiple occasions. The four methods considered are the likelihood ratio test (LRT), the multivariate Wald test (MWT), the modified multivariate Wald test (MMWT), and the score test (ST). Simulation studies were conducted to examine the true positive rate (TPR) and the false positive rate (FPR) of the new methods under a conventional fixed-form test and a computerized adaptive test (CAT). Manipulated variables included the number of occasions, change magnitudes, patterns of change, and correlations between latent traits. Results revealed that, in terms of FPR, all methods except MWT had close adherence to the nominal significance level. Among the three methods, the LRT is recommended as it provided a balance between FPR and TPR. Larger change magnitude yielded higher TPR, regardless of the remaining factors. With the same test length, a CAT yielded higher TPR than a conventional test. Real-data examples are provided of identifying psychometrically significant change across two to four occasions using a multivariate adaptive self-report medical outcomes measure from hospitalized patients. The detection of significant change among the three methods agreed highly, and those patients identified as having significant change exhibited large profile differences, which provided support for the valid performance of the proposed methods.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVES

There were three aims of this study, the first was to examine the efficacy of CBT versus treatment-as-usual (TAU) in the treatment of anxiety and depressive disorders, the second was to examine how TAU is defined in TAU control groups for those disorders, and the third was to explore whether the type of TAU condition influences the estimate of effects of CBT.

METHOD

A systematic search of Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, and CINAHL was conducted.

RESULTS

48 studies of CBT for depressive or anxiety disorders (n=6926) that specified that their control group received TAU were identified. Most (n=45/48) provided an explanation of the TAU group however there was significant heterogeneity amongst TAU conditions. The meta-analysis showed medium effects favoring CBT over TAU for both anxiety (g=0.69, 95{\%} CI 0.47-0.92, p{\textless}0.001, n=1318) and depression (g=0.70, 95{\%} CI 0.49-0.90, p{\textless}0.001, n=5054), with differential effects observed across TAU conditions.

CONCLUSIONS

CBT is superior to TAU and the size of the effect of CBT compared to TAU depends on the nature of the TAU condition. The term TAU is used in different ways and should be more precisely described. The four key details to be reported can be thought of as {\textquotedbl}who, what, how many, and any additional treatments?{\textquotedbl}},

However, these claims are typically supported by measurement-level models that fail to consider the effects of measurement (un)reliability. We use intuitive examples, Monte Carlo simulations, and a novel analytical framework to demonstrate that common strategies for establishing incremental construct validity using multiple regression analysis exhibit extremely high Type I error rates under parameter regimes common in many psychological domains. Counterintuitively, we find that error rates are highest--in some cases approaching 100{\%}--when sample sizes are large and reliability is moderate. Our findings suggest that a potentially large proportion of incremental validity claims made in the literature are spurious. We present a web application (http://jakewestfall.org/ivy/) that readers can use to explore the statistical properties of these and other incremental validity arguments. We conclude by reviewing SEM-based statistical approaches that appropriately control the Type I error rate when attempting to establish incremental validity.},

 abstract = {Sudden gains are large and stable improvements in an outcome variable between consecutive measurements, for example during a psychological intervention with multiple assessments. Researching these occurrences could help understand individual change processes in longitudinal data. Three criteria are generally used to identify sudden gains in psychological interventions. However, applying these criteria can be time consuming and prone to errors if not fully automated. Adaptations to these criteria and methodological decisions such as how multiple gains are handled vary across studies and are reported with different levels of detail. These problems limit the comparability of individual studies and make it hard to understand or replicate the exact methods used. The R package suddengains provides a set of tools to facilitate sudden gains research. This article illustrates how to use the package to identify sudden gains or sudden losses and how to extract descriptive statistics as well as exportable data files for further analysis. It also outlines how these analyses can be customised to apply adaptations of the standard criteria. The suddengains package therefore offers significant scope to improve the efficiency, reporting, and reproducibility of sudden gains research.},

These investigations, however, have resulted in differing SEM criteria for the MCID or MID. This study reviews and compares two sets of studies: (1) three investigations using a disease-specific HRQOL measure among patient samples with the chronic disease (heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or asthma) that have consistently demonstrated a 1 SEM correspondence with the established MCIDs or MIDs and (2) three investigations among patients referred to physical therapists with back, lower extremity, and neck pain showing that approximately 2.3 SEMs estimated the established MCID standards for three different measures of health status. Chronic disease patients were classified to have a MCID or MID if their global change ratings for the better or the worse were 1, 2, or 3 on a Likert scale ranging from 1 (almost the same, hardly any better, or worse at all) to 7 (a very great deal better or worse). Back pain patients, however, needed average global transition scores of 5, 6, or 7 (a good, a great, or a very great deal better) on the same 7-point Likert scale in order to experience an MCID in their condition. Charting these change levels against their respective SEM-MID criteria provides insight and promise for linking SEM-based criteria to MCID standards for other HRQOL and health status measures.},

Real-time data capture (RTDC) techniques have rapidly developed with the advent of computer and information technology. We plan to discuss the use of RTDC in the assessment of pain, including issues pertaining to its rationale, sampling protocols, and our opinion on the current status of the methodology.

DESIGN

This is {\textquotedbl}thought{\textquotedbl} piece involving no systematic data collection methods.

RESULTS

We described the rationale for using RTDC, including issues in recall bias, the desire for detailed information about pain, and the ability to examine within-person associations between pain and other variables. The mechanics of RTDC implementations were discussed with a focus on sampling protocols and data collection methods. The final section concerned the status of RTDC. Current acceptance of RTDC is evaluated and three issues in the science of RTDC were discussed: the interpretation of differences between recall and the average of momentary assessments for the same period; if RTDC is advancing our understanding of pain; and, the issue of what consumers of pain assessments actually desire. RTDC extensions to feedback based on momentary assessments are also discussed.

CONCLUSION

Real-time data collection can be a useful methodology for improving our understanding of pain and especially of its dynamic nature in real-world settings.},

@article{Schreuder.2020,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Intensive longitudinal (IL) designs provide the potential to study symptoms as they evolve in real-time within individuals. This has promising clinical implications, potentially allowing conclusions at the level of specific individuals. The current study aimed to establish the feasibility of IL designs, as indicated by self-rated burden and attrition, in the context of psychiatry. Additionally, we evaluated three core assumptions about the instruments (diary items) used in IL designs. These assumptions are: diary items (1) reflect experiences that change over time within individuals (indicated by item variability), (2) are interpreted consistently over time, and (3) correspond to retrospective assessments of psychopathology.

METHODS

TRAILS TRANS-ID is an add-on IL study in the clinical cohort of the TRAILS study. Daily diaries on psychopathological symptoms for six consecutive months were completed by 134 at risk young adults (age 22.6 $\pm$ 0.6 years). At baseline, immediately after the diary period, and one year after the diary period, participants completed a diagnostic interview.

RESULTS

Excellent compliance (88.5{\%} of the diaries completed), low participant burden (M = 3.21; SD = 1.42; range 1-10), and low attrition (8.2{\%}) supported the feasibility of six-month IL designs. Diary items differed in their variability over time. Evaluation of the consistency of diary item interpretations showed that within-individual variability in scores could not be attributed to changing interpretations over time. Further, daily symptom reports reasonably correlated with retrospective assessments (over a six month period) of psychopathology obtained with the diagnostic interview, suggesting that both measures might complement each other.

CONCLUSION

The current study is the first to show that IL designs over extensive periods (i.e., multiple months) in psychiatry are feasible, and meet three core assumptions to study change in psychopathology. This might allow for addressing novel and promising hypotheses in our field, and might substantially alter how we treat and study mental ill-health.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

Monitoring depressive symptoms during treatment can guide clinical decision making and improve outcomes. The aim of this study was to explore values on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) that could predict response to treatment.

METHOD

Data came from two independent trials, including three treatment modalities of cognitive-behavioral treatment for depression. Four hundred eighty-seven participants who either met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition criteria for major depressive disorder or had PHQ-9 scores consistent with a diagnosis of depression were included in our analyses. Participants either received 18 weeks of telephone or face-to-face (n=279) or 8 weeks of Web-delivered (n=208) cognitive-behavioral therapy. Depressive symptoms, evaluated using the PHQ-9, were reported every 4 weeks in the telephone and face-to-face trial and weekly in the Web-delivered intervention trial.

RESULTS

Optimal cut points for predicting end-of-treatment response were consistent in both trials. Our results suggested using cut points of a PHQ-9 $\geq$17 at Week 4, and PHQ-9 $\geq$13 at Week 9 and PHQ-9 $\geq$9 at Week 14.

CONCLUSIONS

Consistent cut points were found within the included trials. These cut points may be valuable for algorithms to support clinical decision making.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Web-based and blended (face-to-face plus Web-based) interventions for mental health disorders are gaining significance. However, many licensed psychotherapists still have guarded attitudes toward computer-assisted therapy, hindering dissemination efforts.

OBJECTIVE

The objective of this study was to provide a therapist-oriented evaluation of Web-based and blended therapies and identify commonalities and differences in attitudes toward both formats. Furthermore, it aimed to test the impact of an information clip on expressed attitudes.

METHODS

In total, 95 Austrian psychotherapists were contacted and surveyed via their listed occupational email address. An 8-minute information video was shown to half of the therapists before 19 advantages and 13 disadvantages had to be rated on a 6-point Likert scale.

RESULTS

The sample resembled all assessed properties of Austrian psychotherapists (age, theoretical orientation, and region). Therapists did not hold a uniform overall preference. Instead, perceived advantages of both interventions were rated as neutral (t94=1.89, P=.06; d=0.11), whereas Web-based interventions were associated with more disadvantages and risks (t94=9.86, P{\textless}.001; d=0.81). The information clip did not excerpt any detectable effect on therapists' attitudes (r95=-.109, P=.30). The application of modern technologies in the own therapeutic practice and cognitive behavioral orientation were positively related to the given ratings.

CONCLUSIONS

This study is the first to directly compare therapists' attitudes toward Web-based and blended therapies. Positive attitudes play a pivotal role in the dissemination of new technologies, but unexperienced therapists seem to lack knowledge on how to benefit from technology-aided treatments. To speed up implementation, these aspects need to be addressed in the development of new interventions. Furthermore, the preference of blended treatments over Web-based interventions seems to relate to avoidance of risks. Although this study is likely to represent therapists' attitudes in countries with less advanced electronic health services, therapists' attitudes in more advanced countries might present differently.},

@article{Schuster.2020,
 abstract = {Smartphone-based devices are increasingly recognized to assess disease symptoms in daily life (e.g. ecological momentary assessment, EMA). Despite this development in digital psychiatry, clinical trials are mainly based on point assessments of psychopathology. This study investigated expectable increases in statistical power by intense assessment in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A simulation study, based on three scenarios and several empirical data sets, estimated power gains of two- or fivefold pre-post-assessment. For each condition, data sets of various effect sizes were generated, and AN(C)OVAs were applied to the sample of interest (N~=~50-N~=~200). Power increases ranged from 6{\%} to 92{\%}, with higher gains in more underpowered scenarios and with higher number of repeated assessments. ANCOVA profited from a more precise estimation of the baseline covariate, resulting in additional gains in statistical power. Fivefold pre-post EMA resulted in highest absolute statistical power and clearly outperformed traditional questionnaire assessments. For example, ANCOVA of automatized PHQ-9 questionnaire data resulted in absolute power of 55 (for N~=~200 and d~=~0.3). Fivefold EMA, however, resulted in power of 88.9. Non-parametric and multi-level analyses resulted in comparable outcomes. Besides providing psychological treatment, digital mental health can help optimizing sensitivity in RCT-based research. Intense assessment appears advisable whenever psychopathology needs to be assessed with high precision at pre- and post-assessment (e.g. small sample sizes, small treatment effects, or when applying optimization problems like machine learning). First empiric studies are promising, but more evidence is needed. Simulations for various effects and a short guide for popular power software are provided for study planning.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Blended group therapy combines group sessions with Web- and mobile-based treatment modules. Consequently, blended group therapy widens the choice within blended interventions at reasonable costs. This is the first qualitative study on blended group therapy.

OBJECTIVE

The objective of this study was to investigate the patient-centered feasibility of blended group therapy for major depression, with special emphasis on the fit and dynamic interplay between face-to-face and internet-based elements.

METHODS

A total of 22 patients who had a variety of experiences through participating in one of the two blended group therapy interventions were interviewed following a semistructured interview guide. In-depth interviews were analyzed by three trained psychologists, using thematic analysis and a rule-guided internet-based program (QCAmap). The transcript of the interviews (113,555 words) was reduced to 1081 coded units, with subsequent extraction of 16 themes.

RESULTS

Web- and mobile-based elements were described as a treatment facilitator and motivator, increasing the salience and consolidation of cognitive behavioral therapy materials, resulting in in- and inter-session alignment to the treatment. Additionally, patients valued the option of intimate Web-based self-disclosure (by lateral patient-therapist communication), and therapists were provided with tools for between-session monitoring and reinforcement of exercising. In this context, group phenomena seemed to back up therapists' efforts to increase treatment engagement. The dissonance because of noncompliance with Web-based tasks and the constriction of in-session group interaction were considered as possible negative effects. Finally, issues of tailoring and structure seemed to fulfill different preconditions compared with individual therapy.

CONCLUSIONS

Blended group therapy constitutes a structured and proactive approach to work with depression, and the integration of both modalities initiates a beneficial interplay. Results support the patient-centered value of blended group therapy and provide the first insight into blended group therapy's role in fostering therapeutic treatment factors. However, potential negative effects should be considered carefully.},

Despite the well-documented literature about its principal uses and statistical properties, the corresponding power analysis for the general linear hypothesis tests of treatment differences remains a less discussed issue. The frequently recommended procedure is a direct application of the ANOVA formula in combination with a reduced degrees of freedom and a correlation-adjusted variance. This article aims to explicate the conceptual problems and practical limitations of the common method. An exact approach is proposed for power and sample size calculations in ANCOVA with random assignment and multinormal covariates. Both theoretical examination and numerical simulation are presented to justify the advantages of the suggested technique over the current formula. The improved solution is illustrated with an example regarding the comparative effectiveness of interventions. In order to facilitate the application of the described power and sample size calculations, accompanying computer programs are also presented.},

Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) involves repeated sampling of subjects' current behaviors and experiences in real time, in subjects' natural environments. EMA aims to minimize recall bias, maximize ecological validity, and allow study of microprocesses that influence behavior in real-world contexts. EMA studies assess particular events in subjects' lives or assess subjects at periodic intervals, often by random time sampling, using technologies ranging from written diaries and telephones to electronic diaries and physiological sensors. We discuss the rationale for EMA, EMA designs, methodological and practical issues, and comparisons of EMA and recall data.

Information about emotional experience in the natural environment was obtained using answer-only cell phones, while MDD youths received an 8-week course of cognitive behavioral therapy and/or psychopharmacological treatment. Compared with CON youths, MDD youths reported more intense and labile global negative affect; greater sadness, anger, and nervousness; and a lower ratio of positive to negative affect. These differences increased with pubertal maturation. MDD youths spent more time alone and less time with their families than CON youths. Although differences in emotional experiences were found across social contexts, MDD youths were more negative than CON youths in all contexts examined. As the MDD participants progressed through treatment, diagnostic group differences in the intensity and lability of negative affect decreased, but there were no changes in the ratio of positive to negative affect or in measures of social context. We discuss methodological innovations and advantages of this approach, including improved ecological validity and access to information about variability in emotions, change in emotions over time, the balance of positive and negative emotions, and the social context of emotional experience.},

While anchor- and distribution-based statistical methods are well-established, qualitative approaches are less frequently used. This commentary summarizes and expands on a symposium presented at the International Society for Quality of Life Research (ISOQOL) 2017 annual conference, which provided an overview of qualitative methods that can be used to support understanding of meaningful change thresholds on COAs. Further published literature and additional examples from multiple disease areas which have also qualitatively explored the concept of meaningful change are presented.Semi-structured interviews conducted independently from a clinical trial, exit interviews conducted in the context of a clinical trial, focus groups, vignettes and the Delphi panel method can be used to obtain data regarding meaningful change thresholds, with advantages and disadvantages to each method. Semi-structured interviews using concept elicitation (CE) or cognitive debriefing (CD) methods conducted independently from a clinical trial can be an efficient way to gain in-depth patient/caregiver insights. However, there can be challenges~with reconciling heterogeneous data across diverse samples and in interpreting the qualitative insights in the context of quantitative score changes. Semi-structured qualitative interviews using CE/CD methods embedded as exit interviews in a clinical trial context with patients/caregivers can provide insights which can augment quantitative findings based on analysis of clinical trial data. However, there are logistical challenges relating to embedding the interviews in a clinical trial.Focus groups and the~Delphi panel method can be valuable for reaching consensus regarding meaningful change thresholds; however, for face-to-face interactions, social desirability bias can affect responses. Finally, using vignettes and taking a mixed methods approach can aid in achieving consensus on the minimum score change endorsed by respondents as a meaningful improvement/decrement. However, the approach can be cognitively challenging for participants~and reaching a~consensus is not~guaranteed.Anchor- and distribution- based methods remain critical in establishing responder definitions. Nonetheless, qualitative data has the potential to provide complementary support that a certain level of change on the target COA, which has been statistically supported, is truly important and meaningful for the target population.},

@article{Stein.2012,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

The diagnosis of dementia includes evidence of decline in cognitive functioning over time measured by objective cognitive tasks. Normative data for changes adjusted for the impact of socio-demographic factors on cognitive test performance are lacking to interpret changes in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) test scores.

METHOD

As part of the German Study on Ageing, Cognition and Dementia in Primary Care Patients (AgeCoDe Study), a sample of 1090 cognitively healthy individuals, aged 75 years and older, was assessed at 1.5-year intervals over a period of 4.5 years using the MMSE. Age- and education-specific Reliable Change Indices (RCIs) were computed.

RESULTS

Age and education were significantly associated with MMSE test performance, and gender indicated no impact. Across different age and education subgroups, changes from at least 2 up to 3 points indicated significant (i.e., reliable) changes in MMSE test scores at the 90{\%} confidence level. Furthermore, the calculation of RCIs for individual patients is demonstrated.

CONCLUSION

This study provides age- and education-specific MMSE norms based upon RCI methods to interpret cognitive changes in older age groups. The computation of RCI scores improves the interpretation of changes in MMSE test scores by controlling for measurement error, practice effects, or regression to the mean.},

However, inferences from such scores can be biased if psychometric properties such as unidimensionality and temporal measurement invariance for instruments are not met. Here, we aimed to evaluate these properties for common measures of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment-7) in a large clinical sample (N = 22,362) undergoing psychotherapy. In addition, we tested consistency in dimensionality results across different methods (parallel analysis, factor analysis, explained common variance, the partial credit model, and the Mokken model). Results showed that while both Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment-7 are multidimensional instruments with highly correlated factors, there is justification for sum scores as measures of severity. Temporal measurement invariance across 10 therapy sessions was evaluated. Strict temporal measurement invariance was established in both scales, allowing researchers to compare sum scores as severity measures across time.},

First, we combine well-known analytical approaches to conduct a comprehensive assessment of agreement and correlation of rating-pairs and to dis-entangle these often confused concepts, providing a best-practice example on concrete data and a tutorial for future reference. Second, we explore whether a screening questionnaire developed for use with parents can be reliably employed with daycare teachers when assessing early expressive vocabulary. A total of 53 vocabulary rating pairs (34 parent-teacher and 19 mother-father pairs) collected for two-year-old children (12 bilingual) are evaluated. First, inter-rater reliability both within and across subgroups is assessed using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Next, based on this analysis of reliability and on the test-retest reliability of the employed tool, inter-rater agreement is analyzed, magnitude and direction of rating differences are considered. Finally, Pearson correlation coefficients of standardized vocabulary scores are calculated and compared across subgroups. The results underline the necessity to distinguish between reliability measures, agreement and correlation. They also demonstrate the impact of the employed reliability on agreement evaluations. This study provides evidence that parent-teacher ratings of children's early vocabulary can achieve agreement and correlation comparable to those of mother-father ratings on the assessed vocabulary scale. Bilingualism of the evaluated child decreased the likelihood of raters' agreement. We conclude that future reports of agreement, correlation and reliability of ratings will benefit from better definition of terms and stricter methodological approaches. The methodological tutorial provided here holds the potential to increase comparability across empirical reports and can help improve research practices and knowledge transfer to educational and therapeutic settings.},

In Part 2, we explain how, given uncertain effect size estimates, well-powered studies can be designed with sequential analyses. In Part 3, we (a) explain what p values convey about the likelihood that an effect is true, (b) illustrate how the v statistic can be used to evaluate the accuracy of individual studies, and (c) show how the evidential value of multiple studies can be examined with a p-curve analysis. We end by discussing the consequences of incorporating our recommendations in terms of a reduced quantity, but increased quality, of the research output.

 abstract = {AIMS

Suppose you are the developer of a new therapy for a mental health problem or you have several years of experience working with such a therapy, and you would like to prove that it is effective. Randomised trials have become the gold standard to prove that interventions are effective, and they are used by treatment guidelines and policy makers to decide whether or not to adopt, implement or fund a therapy.

METHODS

You would want to do such a randomised trial to get your therapy disseminated, but in reality your clinical experience already showed you that the therapy works. How could you do a trial in order to optimise the chance of finding a positive effect?

RESULTS

Methods that can help include a strong allegiance towards the therapy, anything that increases expectations and hope in participants, making use of the weak spots of randomised trials (risk of bias), small sample sizes and waiting list control groups (but not comparisons with existing interventions). And if all that fails one can always not publish the outcomes and wait for positive trials.

CONCLUSIONS

Several methods are available to help you show that your therapy is effective, even when it is not.},

@article{Cuijpers.2010,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

No meta-analytical study has examined whether the quality of the studies examining psychotherapy for adult depression is associated with the effect sizes found. This study assesses this association.

METHOD

We used a database of 115 randomized controlled trials in which 178 psychotherapies for adult depression were compared to a control condition. Eight quality criteria were assessed by two independent coders: participants met diagnostic criteria for a depressive disorder, a treatment manual was used, the therapists were trained, treatment integrity was checked, intention-to-treat analyses were used, N {\textgreater}or= 50, randomization was conducted by an independent party, and assessors of outcome were blinded.

RESULTS

Only 11 studies (16 comparisons) met the eight quality criteria. The standardized mean effect size found for the high-quality studies (d=0.22) was significantly smaller than in the other studies (d=0.74, p{\textless}0.001), even after restricting the sample to the subset of other studies that used the kind of care-as-usual or non-specific controls that tended to be used in the high-quality studies. Heterogeneity was zero in the group of high-quality studies. The numbers needed to be treated in the high-quality studies was 8, while it was 2 in the lower-quality studies.

CONCLUSIONS

We found strong evidence that the effects of psychotherapy for adult depression have been overestimated in meta-analytical studies. Although the effects of psychotherapy are significant, they are much smaller than was assumed until now, even after controlling for the type of control condition used.},

@article{Cuijpers.2011,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), a structured and time-limited therapy, has been studied in many controlled trials. Numerous practice guidelines have recommended IPT as a treatment of choice for unipolar depressive disorders. The authors conducted a meta-analysis to integrate research on the effects of IPT.

METHOD

The authors searched bibliographical databases for randomized controlled trials comparing IPT with no treatment, usual care, other psychological treatments, and pharmacotherapy as well as studies comparing combination treatment using pharmacotherapy and IPT. Maintenance studies were also included.

RESULTS

Thirty-eight studies including 4,356 patients met all inclusion criteria. The overall effect size (Cohen's d) of the 16 studies that compared IPT and a control group was 0.63 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI]=0.36 to 0.90), corresponding to a number needed to treat of 2.91. Ten studies comparing IPT and other psychological treatments showed a nonsignificant differential effect size of 0.04 (95{\%} CI=-0.14 to 0.21; number needed to treat=45.45) favoring IPT. Pharmacotherapy (after removal of one outlier) was more effective than IPT (d=-0.19, 95{\%} CI=-0.38 to -0.01; number needed to treat=9.43), and combination treatment was not more effective than IPT alone, although the paucity of studies precluded drawing definite conclusions. Combination maintenance treatment with pharmacotherapy and IPT was more effective in preventing relapse than pharmacotherapy alone (odds ratio=0.37; 95{\%} CI=0.19 to 0.73; number needed to treat=7.63).

CONCLUSIONS

There is no doubt that IPT efficaciously treats depression, both as an independent treatment and in combination with pharmacotherapy. IPT deserves its place in treatment guidelines as one of the most empirically validated treatments for depression.},

@article{Ebert.2016,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Almost nothing is known about the potential negative effects of Internet-based psychological treatments for depression. This study aims at investigating deterioration and its moderators within randomized trials on Internet-based guided self-help for adult depression, using an individual patient data meta-analyses (IPDMA) approach.

METHOD

Studies were identified through systematic searches (PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Cochrane Library). Deterioration in participants was defined as a significant symptom increase according to the reliable change index (i.e. 7.68 points in the CES-D; 7.63 points in the BDI). Two-step IPDMA procedures, with a random-effects model were used to pool data.

RESULTS

A total of 18 studies (21 comparisons, 2079 participants) contributed data to the analysis. The risk for a reliable deterioration from baseline to post-treatment was significantly lower in the intervention v. control conditions (3.36 v. 7.60; relative risk 0.47, 95{\%} confidence interval 0.29-0.75). Education moderated effects on deterioration, with patients with low education displaying a higher risk for deterioration than patients with higher education. Deterioration rates for patients with low education did not differ statistically significantly between intervention and control groups. The benefit-risk ratio for patients with low education indicated that 9.38 patients achieve a treatment response for each patient experiencing a symptom deterioration.

CONCLUSIONS

Internet-based guided self-help is associated with a mean reduced risk for a symptom deterioration compared to controls. Treatment and symptom progress of patients with low education should be closely monitored, as some patients might face an increased risk for symptom deterioration. Future studies should examine predictors of deterioration in patients with low education.},

Although DSM eating disorder (ED) diagnoses have been criticized for poor clinical utility, instability, and uncertainty, remission/change of diagnosis is often the standard for evaluating outcome. We tested the validity of the clinically significant reliable change index (CS/RCI) compared to change in DSM-IV ED-diagnoses. We investigated if CS/RCI was concordant to diagnostic change and compared explained variance on measures at follow-up. Using a database for specialized ED treatment in Sweden the sample contained 1042 female patients (246 adolescents/796 adults). CS/RCI was calculated for the Clinical Impairment Assessment (CIA) and the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q). CS/RCI explained more variance in gain scores for psychopathology measures than diagnostic change (DSM-IV). Average agreement between diagnostic change and CS/RCI was 62{\%} and 60{\%} for CIA and EDE-Q, respectively. Diagnostic change always resulted in more positive outcome than CS/RCI. Together with clinical judgment, CS/RCI is a valuable method for determining clinically significant changes in clinical practice and research. It is economically sound and results are easily interpreted and communicated to patients.},

Despite their superior statistical properties (e.g., less stringent assumptions, greater accuracy and power), the adoption of these modern analytic approaches is not uniform in psychology and related disciplines. Thus, the primary goal of this manuscript is to describe and illustrate the application of multiple imputation. Although maximum likelihood estimation is perhaps the easiest method to use in practice, psychological data sets often feature complexities that are currently difficult to handle appropriately in the likelihood framework (e.g., mixtures of categorical and continuous variables), but relatively simple to treat with imputation. The paper describes a number of practical issues that clinical researchers are likely to encounter when applying multiple imputation, including mixtures of categorical and continuous variables, item-level missing data in questionnaires, significance testing, interaction effects, and multilevel missing data. Analysis examples illustrate imputation with software packages that are freely available on the internet.},

@article{Erbe.2016,
 abstract = {Background

Computerized versions of well-established measurements such as the PHQ-9 are widely used, but data on the comparability of psychometric properties are scarce.

Objective

Our objective was to compare the interformat reliability of the paper-and-pen version with a computerized version of the PHQ-9 in a clinical sample.

Methods

130 participants with mental health disorders were recruited during psychotherapeutic treatment in a mental health clinic. In a crossover design, they all completed the PHQ-9 in both the computerized and paper-and-pen versions in randomized order.

Results

The internal consistency was comparable for the computer (\textgreek{a}~=~0.88) and paper versions (\textgreek{a}~=~0.89), and highly significant correlations were found between the formats (r~=~0.92). PHQ-9 total scores were not significantly different between the paper and the computer delivered versions. There was a significant interaction effect between format and order of administration for the PHQ-9, indicating that the first administration delivered slightly higher scores.

Limitations

In order to reduce the required effort for the participants, we did not ask them to fill out anything but the PHQ-9 once in paper and once in computer version.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that the PHQ-9 can be transferred to computerized use without affecting psychometric properties in a clinically meaningful way.},

The relation can be assumed to be linear, and was found regardless of sample size, pre-post correlation, and shape of the scores' distribution, both in single group designs and in experimental designs with a control group. We encourage other researchers to use IBC statistics to evaluate their effect sizes because: (a) they allow the identification of cases that changed reliably; (b) they facilitate the interpretation and communication of results; and (c) they provide a straightforward evaluation of the magnitude of empirical effects while avoiding the problems of arbitrary general cutoffs.},

For this reason, a nonchange situation was simulated (pre-post design with no differences between pre and post) and the behavior of 8 different methods was evaluated in this scenario. Different distributions as well as different sample sizes were simulated. A thousand samples were created for each simulated condition. The percentage of times each method detected a change was obtained in order to evaluate the behavior of the selected methods. Because the simulated situation is a nonchange one, any change alert was considered as a false positive. Out of the 8 evaluated methods, the standardized individual difference and the confidence intervals of linear regression are the ones with the best performance. The remaining methods fail to correctly identify and reject sampling random fluctuations. In most cases there is a tendency to consider changes that respond only to random variations as statistically reliable. However, a simple modification related in reliability estimation allows a considerable improvement in the behavior of some methods.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

The common self-rated depression scales are lengthy, old and do not reflect the current diagnostic classifications criteria of depressive disorders. This study aimed to validate the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) as a screening tool for depression amongst Nigerian university students.

METHODS

A representative sample of university students (n=512) completed the PHQ-9 and the Beck's Depressive Inventory (BDI). They were also interviewed for clinical diagnoses of depressive disorders using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI).

RESULTS

The internal consistency of questions within the PHQ-9 was 0.85. The PHQ-9 had good concurrent validity with the BDI (r=0.67, P{\textless}0.001). It also had a good (r=0.894, P{\textless}0.001) one month test-retest reliability. Using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, the optimal cut-off score for minor depressive disorder is 5 (sensitivity 0.897, specificity 0.989, Positive Predictive Value - PPV 0.875, Negative Predictive Value - NPV 0.981 and Overall Correct Classification - OCC rate 0.973) while for major depressive disorder only is 10 (sensitivity 0.846, specificity 0.994, PPV 0.750, NPV 0.996 and OCC rate 0.992).

LIMITATIONS

The study limitations include use of a specific group in community, moderate sample size and screening for only minor and major depressive disorders while neglecting other depressive disorders.

CONCLUSIONS

The PHQ-9 has good psychometric properties amongst Nigerian university students. Because of its validity, reliability, brevity and ease of administration, the PHQ-9 will be a valuable tool for estimating depression amongst college students in Nigerian community. More studies are needed to test the usefulness of the translated local language versions of this instrument amongst the community in sub-Saharan Africa.},

@article{Bangdiwala.2013,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

When assessing the concordance between two methods of measurement of ordinal categorical data, summary measures such as Cohen's (1960) kappa or Bangdiwala's (1985) B-statistic are used. However, a picture conveys more information than a single summary measure.

METHODS

We describe how to construct and interpret Bangdiwala's (1985) agreement chart and illustrate its use in visually assessing concordance in several example clinical applications.

RESULTS

The agreement charts provide a visual impression that no summary statistic can convey, and summary statistics reduce the information to a single characteristic of the data. However, the visual impression is personal and subjective, and not usually reproducible from one reader to another.

CONCLUSIONS

The agreement chart should be used to complement the summary kappa or B-statistics, not to replace them. The graphs can be very helpful to researchers as an early step to understand relationships in their data when assessing concordance.},

Following the operational definition of clinically significant change offered by Jacobson, Follette, and Revenstorf (1984), several alternatives have been proposed because they were thought to be either more accurate or more sensitive to detecting meaningful change. In this study, we compared five methods using a sample of 386 outpatients who underwent treatment in routine clinical practice. Differences were found between methods, suggesting that the statistical method used to calculate clinical significance has an effect on estimates of meaningful change. The Jacobson method (Jacobson {\&} Truax, 1991) provided a moderate estimate of treatment effects and was recommended for use in outcome studies and research on clinically significant change, but future research is needed to validate this statistical method.},

Although these methods are frequently used to assess cognitive change after epilepsy surgery in adults, they have not been widely applied to examine cognitive change in children with epilepsy. The goal of the current study was to develop RCIs and SRB change score norms for use in children with epilepsy. Sixty-three children with epilepsy (age range: 6-16; M=10.19, SD=2.58) underwent comprehensive neuropsychological evaluations at two time points an average of 12 months apart. Practice effect-adjusted RCIs and SRB change score norms were calculated for all cognitive measures in the battery. Practice effects were quite variable across the neuropsychological measures, with the greatest differences observed among older children, particularly on the Children's Memory Scale and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. There was also notable variability in test-retest reliabilities across measures in the battery, with coefficients ranging from 0.14 to 0.92. Reliable change indices and SRB change score norms for use in assessing meaningful cognitive change in children following epilepsy surgery are provided for measures with reliability coefficients above 0.50. This is the first study to provide RCIs and SRB change score norms for a comprehensive neuropsychological battery based on a large sample of children with epilepsy. Tables to aid in evaluating cognitive changes in children who have undergone epilepsy surgery are provided for clinical use. An Excel sheet to perform all relevant calculations is also available to interested clinicians or researchers.},

Our results delineate the potential scope and impact of nonergodic data in human subjects research. Analyses across six samples (with 87-94 participants and an equal number of assessments per participant) showed some degree of agreement in central tendency estimates (mean) between groups and individuals across constructs and data collection paradigms. However, the variance around the expected value was two to four times larger within individuals than within groups. This suggests that literatures in social and medical sciences may overestimate the accuracy of aggregated statistical estimates. This observation could have serious consequences for how we understand the consistency between group and individual correlations, and the generalizability of conclusions between domains.

@article{Fisher.2011,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

The present article aimed to demonstrate that the establishment of dynamic patterns during the course of psychotherapy can create attractor states for continued adaptive change following the conclusion of treatment.

METHOD

This study is a secondary analysis of T. D. Borkovec and E. Costello (1993). Of the 55 participants in the original study, 33 were retained for the present analysis due to the homogeneity of psychotherapy outcome among these participants. Of these 33, the majority were White (88{\%}) and female (70{\%}), and the average age was 35.44 years (SD = 14.46). Participants participated in 12 weeks of either cognitive behavioral therapy or applied relaxation. Daily diary entries from the treatment period were subjected to time series analyses in order to determine the degree of order versus disorder present within individual dynamic systems. These idiographic data were then aggregated for nomothetic analysis of treatment outcome via linear mixed effect models.

RESULTS

Spectral power due to daily to intradaily oscillations in thrice-daily diary data significantly moderated reliable change over posttreatment follow-up such that lesser power predicted increases in reliable change over the 1-year follow-up period. Additionally, residual variance for dynamic factor models significantly moderated the slope for change over the follow-up period, such that lesser variance--and thus greater order in dynamic systems--predicted increases in reliable change.

CONCLUSIONS

The degree of order in dynamic systems established during therapy acted as an adaptive attractor state, promoting continued positive gains 1 year after the conclusion of therapy. The present study represents an important innovation in the study of dynamic systems in psychotherapy.},

@article{Hurst.2004,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

To date, clinical trials have relied almost exclusively on the statistical significance of changes in scores from outcome measures in interpreting the effectiveness of treatment interventions. It is becoming increasingly important, however, to determine the clinical rather than statistical significance of these change scores.

OBJECTIVE

To determine cutoff values for change scores that distinguish patients who have clinically improved from those who have not.

METHOD

Data were obtained from 165 back and 100 neck patients undergoing chiropractic treatment. Patients completed the Bournemouth Questionnaire (BQ) before treatment and the BQ and Patient's Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale after treatment. Three statistical methods were applied to individual change scores on the BQ. These were (1) the Reliable Change Index (RCI); (2) the effect size (ES); and (3) the raw and percentage change scores. The PGIC scale was used as the {\textquotedbl}gold standard{\textquotedbl} of clinically significant change.

RESULTS

The RCI, using the cutoff value of {\textgreater}1.96, appropriately identified clinical improvement in back patients but not in neck patients. An individual ES of approximately 0.5 had the highest sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing back and neck patients who had undergone clinically significant improvement from those who had not. In terms of raw score changes, percentage BQ change scores [(raw change score/baseline score) x 100] of 47{\%} and 34{\%} were identified as having the highest sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing clinically significant improvement from nonimprovement in back and neck patients, respectively.

CONCLUSION

This study provides a methodological framework for identifying clinically significant change in patients. This approach has important implications in providing clinically relevant information about the effect of a treatment intervention in an individual patient.},

In this article, we lay out the causal structure of individualized treatment effect in terms of potential outcomes and describe the required assumptions that underlie a causal interpretation of its prediction. Subsequently, we describe regression models and model estimation techniques that can be used to move from average to more individualized treatment effect predictions. We focus mainly on logistic regression-based methods that are both well-known and naturally provide the required probabilistic estimates. We incorporate key components from both causal inference and prediction research to arrive at individualized treatment effect predictions. While the separate components are well known, their successful amalgamation is very much an ongoing field of research. We cut the problem down to its essentials in the setting of a randomized trial, discuss the importance of a clear definition of the estimand of interest, provide insight into the required assumptions, and give guidance with respect to modeling and estimation options. Simulated data illustrate the potential of different modeling options across scenarios that vary both average treatment effect and treatment effect heterogeneity.

@article{Karin.2018,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Accurate measurement of treatment-related change is a key part of psychotherapy research and the investigation of treatment efficacy. For this reason, the ability to measure change with accurate and valid methods is critical for psychotherapy.

OBJECTIVE

The aims of this study were to (1) explore the underlying characteristics of depressive symptom change, measured with the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), following psychotherapy, and (2) compare the suitability of different ways to measure and interpret symptom change. A treatment sample of Web-based psychotherapy participants (n=1098) and a waitlist sample (n=96) were used to (1) explore the statistical characteristics of depressive symptom change, and (2) compare the suitability of two common types of change functions: linear and proportional change.

METHODS

These objectives were explored using hypotheses that tested (1) the relationship between baseline symptoms and the rate of change, (2) the shape of symptom score distribution following treatment, and (3) measurement error associated with linear and proportional measurement models.

RESULTS

Findings demonstrated that (1) individuals with severe depressive baseline symptoms had greater reductions in symptom scores than individuals with mild baseline symptoms (11.4 vs 3.7); however, as a percentage measurement, change remained similar across individuals with mild, moderate, or severe baseline symptoms (50{\%}-55{\%}); (2) positive skewness was observed in PHQ-9 score distributions following treatment; and (3) models that measured symptom change as a proportional function resulted in greater model fit and reduced measurement error ({\textless}30{\%}).

CONCLUSIONS

This study suggests that symptom scales, sharing an implicit feature of score bounding, are associated with a proportional function of change. Selecting statistics that overlook this proportional change (eg, Cohen d) is problematic and leads to (1) artificially increased estimates of change with higher baseline symptoms, (2) increased measurement error, and (3) confounded estimates of treatment efficacy and clinical change. Implications, limitations, and idiosyncrasies from these results are discussed.},

 abstract = {Little is known about clinically relevant changes in guided Internet-based interventions for depression. Moreover, methodological and power limitations preclude the identification of patients' groups that may benefit more from these interventions. This study aimed to investigate response rates, remission rates, and their moderators in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effect of guided Internet-based interventions for adult depression to control groups using an individual patient data meta-analysis approach. Literature searches in PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO and Cochrane Library resulted in 13,384 abstracts from database inception to January 1, 2016. Twenty-four RCTs (4889 participants) comparing a guided Internet-based intervention with a control group contributed data to the analysis. Missing data were multiply imputed. To examine treatment outcome on response and remission, mixed-effects models with participants nested within studies were used. Response and remission rates were calculated using the Reliable Change Index. The intervention group obtained significantly higher response rates (OR = 2.49, 95{\%} CI 2.17-2.85) and remission rates compared to controls (OR = 2.41, 95{\%} CI 2.07-2.79). The moderator analysis indicated that older participants (OR = 1.01) and native-born participants (1.66) were more likely to respond to treatment compared to younger participants and ethnic minorities respectively. Age (OR = 1.01) and ethnicity (1.73) also moderated the effects of treatment on remission.Moreover, adults with more severe depressive symptoms at baseline were more likely to remit after receiving internet-based treatment (OR = 1.19). Guided Internet-based interventions lead to substantial positive treatment effects on treatment response and remission at post-treatment. Thus, such interventions may complement existing services for depression and potentially reduce the gap between the need and provision of evidence-based treatments.},

Despite widespread interest in the intermediate behaviors and mechanisms that convey treatment effects, there is limited guidance on how to effectively and efficiently design studies to detect such mediated effects in the types of partially nested designs that commonly arise in psychotherapy research.

@article{King.2019,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Patient-reported outcome (PRO) data may be used at 2 levels: to evaluate impacts of disease and treatment aggregated across individuals (group-level) and to screen/monitor individual patients to inform their management (individual-level). For PRO data to be useful at either level, we need to understand their clinical relevance.

PURPOSE

To provide clarity on whether and how methods historically developed to interpret group-based PRO research results might be applied in clinical settings to enable PRO data from individual patients to inform their clinical management and decision-making.

METHODS

We first differentiate PRO-based decision-making required at group versus individual levels. We then summarize established group-based approaches to interpretation (anchor-based and distribution based), and more recent methods that draw on item calibrations and qualitative research methods. We then assess the applicability of these methods to individual patient data and individual-level decision-making.

FINDINGS

Group-based methods provide a range of thresholds that are useful in clinical care: some provide screening thresholds for patients who need additional clinical assessment and/or intervention, some provide thresholds for classifying an individual's level of severity of symptoms or problems with function, and others provide thresholds for meaningful change when monitoring symptoms and functioning over time during or after interventions. Availability of established cut-points for screening and symptom severity, and normative/reference values, may play into choice of PRO measures for use in clinical care. Translatability of thresholds for meaningful change is more problematic because of the greater reliability needed at the individual-level versus group-level, but group-based methods may provide lower bound estimates. Caution is needed to set thresholds above bounds of measurement error to avoid {\textquotedbl}false-positive changes{\textquotedbl} triggering unwarranted alerts and action in clinic.

CONCLUSIONS

While there are some challenges in applying available methods for interpreting group-based PRO results to individual patient data and clinical care-including myriad contextual factors that may influence an individual patient's management and decision-making-they provide a useful starting point, and should be used pragmatically.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Mild to moderate depressive symptoms are common but often remain unrecognized and treated inadequately. We hypothesized that an Internet intervention in addition to usual care is superior to care as usual alone (CAU) in the treatment of mild to moderate depressive symptoms in adults.

METHODS

This trial was controlled, randomized and assessor-blinded. Participants with mild to moderate depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9, score 5-14) were recruited from clinical and non-clinical settings and randomized to either CAU or a 12-week Internet intervention (Deprexis) adjunctive to usual care. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 3 months (post-assessment) and 6 months (follow-up). The primary outcome measure was self-rated depression severity (PHQ-9). The main analysis was based on the intention-to-treat principle and used linear mixed models.

RESULTS

A total of 1,013 participants were randomized. Changes in PHQ-9 from baseline differed signixFB01;cantly between groups (t825 = 6.12, p {\textless} 0.001 for the main effect of group). The post-assessment between-group effect size in favour of the intervention was d = 0.39 (95{\%} CI: 0.13-0.64). It was stable at follow-up, with d = 0.32 (95{\%} CI: 0.06-0.69). The rate of participants experiencing at least minimally clinically important PHQ-9 change at the post-assessment was higher in the intervention group (35.6 vs. 20.2{\%}) with a number needed to treat of 7 (95{\%} CI: 5-10).

CONCLUSIONS

The Internet intervention examined in this trial was superior to CAU alone in reducing mild to moderate depressive symptoms. The magnitude of the effect is clinically important and has public health implications.},

However, the hypotheses that TAIL for individuals with social anxiety or panic disorder is inferior to disorder-specific ICBT could not be rejected (social anxiety: TAIL d = 0.74 versus disorder-specific d = 0.81; panic: TAIL d = 1.11 versus disorder-specific d = 1.47).

@article{Kroenke.2001,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

While considerable attention has focused on improving the detection of depression, assessment of severity is also important in guiding treatment decisions. Therefore, we examined the validity of a brief, new measure of depression severity.

MEASUREMENTS

The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as {\textquotedbl}0{\textquotedbl} (not at all) to {\textquotedbl}3{\textquotedbl} (nearly every day). The PHQ-9 was completed by 6,000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Construct validity was assessed using the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey, self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (MHP) interview in a sample of 580 patients.

RESULTS

As PHQ-9 depression severity increased, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and health care utilization increased. Using the MHP reinterview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-9 score {\textgreater} or =10 had a sensitivity of 88{\%} and a specificity of 88{\%} for major depression. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples.

CONCLUSION

In addition to making criteria-based diagnoses of depressive disorders, the PHQ-9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity. These characteristics plus its brevity make the PHQ-9 a useful clinical and research tool.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Depression, anxiety and somatization are the most common mental disorders in primary care as well as medical specialty populations; each is present in at least 5-10{\%} of patients and frequently comorbid with one another. An efficient means for measuring and monitoring all three conditions would be desirable.

METHODS

Evidence regarding the psychometric and pragmatic characteristics of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 depression, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)-7 anxiety and PHQ-15 somatic symptom scales are synthesized from two sources: (1) four multisite cross-sectional studies (three conducted in primary care and one in obstetric-gynecology practices) comprising 9740 patients, and (2) key studies from the literature that have studied these scales.

RESULTS

The PHQ-9 and its abbreviated eight-item (PHQ-8) and two-item (PHQ-2) versions have good sensitivity and specificity for detecting depressive disorders. Likewise, the GAD-7 and its abbreviated two-item (GAD-2) version have good operating characteristics for detecting generalized anxiety, panic, social anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. The optimal cutpoint is {\textgreater} or = 10 on the parent scales (PHQ-9 and GAD-7) and {\textgreater} or = 3 on the ultra-brief versions (PHQ-2 and GAD-2). The PHQ-15 is equal or superior to other brief measures for assessing somatic symptoms and screening for somatoform disorders. Cutpoints of 5, 10 and 15 represent mild, moderate and severe symptom levels on all three scales. Sensitivity to change is well-established for the PHQ-9 and emerging albeit not yet definitive for the GAD-7 and PHQ-15.

CONCLUSIONS

The PHQ-9, GAD-7 and PHQ-15 are brief well-validated measures for detecting and monitoring depression, anxiety and somatization.},

@article{Karin.2018b,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Missing cases following treatment are common in Web-based psychotherapy trials. Without the ability to directly measure and evaluate the outcomes for missing cases, the ability to measure and evaluate the effects of treatment is challenging. Although common, little is known about the characteristics of Web-based psychotherapy participants who present as missing cases, their likely clinical outcomes, or the suitability of different statistical assumptions that can characterize missing cases.

OBJECTIVE

Using a large sample of individuals who underwent Web-based psychotherapy for depressive symptoms (n=820), the aim of this study was to explore the characteristics of cases who present as missing cases at posttreatment (n=138), their likely treatment outcomes, and compare between statistical methods for replacing their missing data.

METHODS

First, common participant and treatment features were tested through binary logistic regression models, evaluating the ability to predict missing cases. Second, the same variables were screened for their ability to increase or impede the rate symptom change that was observed following treatment. Third, using recontacted cases at 3-month follow-up to proximally represent missing cases outcomes following treatment, various simulated replacement scores were compared and evaluated against observed clinical follow-up scores.

RESULTS

Missing cases were dominantly predicted by lower treatment adherence and increased symptoms at pretreatment. Statistical methods that ignored these characteristics can overlook an important clinical phenomenon and consequently produce inaccurate replacement outcomes, with symptoms estimates that can swing from -32{\%} to 70{\%} from the observed outcomes of recontacted cases. In contrast, longitudinal statistical methods that adjusted their estimates for missing cases outcomes by treatment adherence rates and baseline symptoms scores resulted in minimal measurement bias ({\textless}8{\%}).

CONCLUSIONS

Certain variables can characterize and predict missing cases likelihood and jointly predict lesser clinical improvement. Under such circumstances, individuals with potentially worst off treatment outcomes can become concealed, and failure to adjust for this can lead to substantial clinical measurement bias. Together, this preliminary research suggests that missing cases in Web-based psychotherapeutic interventions may not occur as random events and can be systematically predicted. Critically, at the same time, missing cases may experience outcomes that are distinct and important for a complete understanding of the treatment effect.},

@article{Holmes.2016,
 abstract = {Treatment innovation for bipolar disorder has been hampered by a lack of techniques to capture a hallmark symptom: ongoing mood instability. Mood swings persist during remission from acute mood episodes and impair daily functioning. The last significant treatment advance remains Lithium (in the 1970s), which aids only the minority of patients. There is no accepted way to establish proof of concept for a new mood-stabilizing treatment. We suggest that combining insights from mood measurement with applied mathematics may provide a step change: repeated daily mood measurement (depression) over a short time frame (1 month) can create individual bipolar mood instability profiles. A time-series approach allows comparison of mood instability pre- and post-treatment. We test a new imagery-focused cognitive therapy treatment approach (MAPP; Mood Action Psychology Programme) targeting a driver of mood instability, and apply these measurement methods in a non-concurrent multiple baseline design case series of 14 patients with bipolar disorder. Weekly mood monitoring and treatment target data improved for the whole sample combined. Time-series analyses of daily mood data, sampled remotely (mobile phone/Internet) for 28 days pre- and post-treatment, demonstrated improvements in individuals' mood stability for 11 of 14 patients. Thus the findings offer preliminary support for a new imagery-focused treatment approach. They also indicate a step in treatment innovation without the requirement for trials in illness episodes or relapse prevention. Importantly, daily measurement offers a description of mood instability at the individual patient level in a clinically meaningful time frame. This costly, chronic and disabling mental illness demands innovation in both treatment approaches (whether pharmacological or psychological) and measurement tool: this work indicates that daily measurements can be used to detect improvement in individual mood stability for treatment innovation (MAPP).},

In the present paper, specificity comparisons of several classic and contemporary RC models were made using a real data set. This included a more detailed review of a new RC model recently proposed in this journal, that used the within-subjects standard deviation (WSD) as the error term. It was suggested that the RC(WSD) was more sensitive to change and theoretically superior. The current paper demonstrated that even in the presence of mean practice effects, false-positive rates were comparable across models when reliability was good and initial and retest variances were equivalent. However, when variances differed, discrepancies in classification across models became evident. Notably, the RC using the WSD provided unacceptably high false-positive rates in this setting. It was considered that the WSD was never intended for measuring change in this manner. The WSD actually combines systematic and error variance. The systematic variance comes from measurable between-treatment differences, commonly referred to as practice effect. It was further demonstrated that removal of the systematic variance and appropriate modification of the residual error term for the purpose of testing individual change yielded an error term already published and criticized in the literature. A consensus on the RC approach is needed. To that end, further comparison of models under varied conditions is encouraged.},

Combining face-to-face therapies with internet-based elements in the sense of blended treatment is a new approach to treatment for depression. The goal of this study was to answer the following research questions: (1) What are the most important predictors determining optimal treatment allocation to treatment as usual or blended treatment? and (2) Would model-determined treatment allocation using this predictive information and the personalized advantage index (PAI)-approach result in better treatment outcomes? Bayesian model averaging (BMA) was applied to the data of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the efficacy of treatment as usual and blended treatment in depressive outpatients. Pre-treatment symptomatology and treatment expectancy predicted outcomes irrespective of treatment condition, whereas different prescriptive predictors were found. A PAI of 2.33 PHQ-9 points was found, meaning that patients who would have received the treatment that is optimal for them would have had a post-treatment PHQ-9 score that is two points lower than if they had received the treatment that is suboptimal for them. For 29{\%} of the sample, the PAI was five or greater, which means that a substantial difference between the two treatments was predicted. The use of the PAI approach for clinical practice must be further confirmed in prospective research; the current study supports the identification of specific interventions favorable for specific patients.},

The correct statistical approach to assess this degree of agreement is not obvious. Correlation and regression studies are frequently proposed. However, correlation studies the relationship between one variable and another, not the differences, and it is not recommended as a method for assessing the comparability between methods.  In 1983 Altman and Bland (B{\&}A) proposed an alternative analysis, based on the quantification of the agreement between two quantitative measurements by studying the mean difference and constructing limits of agreement.  The B{\&}A plot analysis is a simple way to evaluate a bias between the mean differences, and to estimate an agreement interval, within which 95{\%} of the differences of the second method, compared to the first one, fall. Data can be analyzed both as unit differences plot and as percentage differences plot.  The B{\&}A plot method only defines the intervals of agreements, it does not say whether those limits are acceptable or not. Acceptable limits must be defined a priori, based on clinical necessity, biological considerations or other goals.  The aim of this article is to provide guidance on the use and interpretation of Bland Altman analysis in method comparison studies.},

 abstract = {Experimental tests of interventions need to have sufficient sample size to constitute a robust test of the intervention's effectiveness with reasonable precision and power. To estimate the required sample size adequately, researchers are required to specify an effect size. But what effect size should be used to plan the required sample size? Various inroads into selecting the a priori effect size have been suggested in the literature-including using conventions, prior research, and theoretical or practical importance. In this paper, we first discuss problems with some of the proposed methods of selecting the effect size for study planning. We then lay out a method for intervention researchers that provides a way out of many of these problems. The proposed method requires setting a meaningful change definition, it is specifically suited for applied researchers interested in planning tests of intervention effectiveness. We provide a hands-on walk through of the method and provide easy-to-use R functions to implement it.},

@article{HintonBayre.2016,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

Several reliable change indices (RCIs) exist to evaluate statistically significant individual change with repeated neuropsychological assessment. Yet there is little guidance on model selection and subsequent implications. Using existing test-retest norms, key parameters were systematically evaluated for influence on different RCI models.

METHOD

Normative test-retest data for selected Wechsler Memory Scale-IV subtests were chosen based on the direction and magnitude of differential practice (inequality of test and retest variance). The influence of individual relative position compared to the normative mean was systematically manipulated to evaluate for predictable differences in responsiveness for three RCI models.

RESULTS

With respect to negative change, RCI McSweeny was most responsive when individual baseline scores were below the normative mean, irrespective of differential practice. When an individual score was greater than the normative mean, RCI Chelune was most responsive with lower retest variance, and RCI Maassen most responsive with greater retest variance. This pattern of results can change when test-retest reliability is excellent and there is greater retest variability. Order of responsiveness is reversed if positive change is of interest.

CONCLUSION

RCI models tend to agree when the individual approximates the normative mean at baseline and test-retest variability is equal. However, no RCI model will be universally more or less responsive across all conditions, and model selection may influence subsequent interpretation of change. Given the systematic and predictable differences between models, a more rationale choice can now be made. While a consensus on RCI model preference does not exist, we prefer the regression-based model for several reasons outlined.},

We evaluated two of the most commonly used depressive symptomatology measures in a sample of clients (N = 240) in residential substance abuse treatment settings. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) has previously been used in clients receiving substance abuse treatment. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), originally developed for primary care settings, has not been used as frequently in substance abuse treatment settings, and it is unknown how it performs in this population. The measures were highly correlated with each other (r = .76) and demonstrated good internal consistency reliability (BDI-II = 0.91, PHQ-9 = 0.87); however, the PHQ-9 classifies more individuals as having {\textquotedbl}mild{\textquotedbl} depression symptoms relative to the BDI-II, which tends to suggest these individuals have no depression symptoms. Implications for assessing depression symptoms in individuals receiving substance abuse treatment are discussed.},

@article{Hieronymus.2020,
 abstract = {In treatment trials, as well as in clinical practice, a number of individuals with depression fail to respond to medications with established antidepressant properties. The presence of such non-responders has been considered as indicative of inter-individual variability in treatment responsiveness, but disparate outcomes between individuals could also be due to other factors, such as inter-individual differences in disease severity and spontaneous improvement (1). To address this issue, recent studies (1,2) have compared variability (specifically standard deviations, SDs) between groups administered active treatment and placebo across trials. When no differences in variability have been found, this has been quoted as an argument against antidepressants being effective or against the value of precision medicine in depression (1).},

The Reliable Change Index (RCI) is most commonly used in psychotherapy research, whereas psychopharmacologists prefer to calculate percentage of improvement (PI). We compared both methods using the Beck Depression Inventory in 395 depressive outpatients. The overall pre-post effect size was d=1.18. The PI-50 ($\geq$ 50{\%} improvement from baseline) resulted in outcome estimates higher than the RCI: 66.3{\%} vs. 59.2{\%} for response and 50.6{\%} vs. 45.8{\%} for remission. We demonstrate that the PI approach is independent of arbitrarily chosen reliabilities and reference populations. Furthermore, it takes differences of pre-treatment severity into account. It is considered as a valuable extension of the established RCI in psychotherapy research.},

 abstract = {The use of reliable change (RC) statistics to determine whether an individual has significantly improved or deteriorated on retesting is growing rapidly in clinical neuropsychology. This paper demonstrates how with only basic test-retest data and a series of simple expressions, the clinician/researcher can implement the majority of contemporary RC model(s). Though sharing a fundamental structure, RC models vary in how they derive predicted retest scores and standard error terms. Published test-retest normative data and a simple case study are presented to demonstrate how to calculate several well-known RC scores. The paper highlights the circumstances under which models will diverge in the estimation of RC. Most importantly variations in individual's performance relative to controls at initial testing, practice effects, inequality of control variability from test to retest, and degree of reliability will see systematic and predictable disagreement among models. More generally, the limitations and opportunities of RC methodology were discussed. Although a consensus on preferred model continues to be debated, the comparison of RC models in clinical samples is encouraged.},
